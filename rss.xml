        <title>Work in Progress: The Future of (My) Web (Part 2, Leaving WhatsApp)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve deleted WhatsApp. I wasn&amp;#39;t going to post about this,
as I don&amp;#39;t want to sound like a broken record.
But, as several people have emailed me asking why,
I thought I would explain my decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2015/12/03/work-in-progress/&quot;&gt;posted about this before&lt;/a&gt;
when I left Facebook.
I&amp;#39;m not just ranting about data surveillance and privacy concerns.
I have other concerns about our relationship with technology. There are
certain ideas that are in danger of becoming locked in unless
we come up with alternatives.
My attitude is solution focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So WhatsWrong with WhatsApp?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It&amp;#39;s free.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They annouced recently that they are removing the subscription and making the service free.
There is now no doubt what the real business model is.
You are not their customer, you are their product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;No API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Acton, WhatsApp cofounder, has publicly stated that there will never be an API.
Interoperability is never going to be an option with Whatsapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare with email: You use gmail, someone else uses hotmail, and I have my own email
software I built myself. We can all freely email each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re on different mobile networks, but we can still freely send each other SMS messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will never be the case with WhatsApp.
If you&amp;#39;re not on WhatsApp you don&amp;#39;t exist.
WhatsApp is a monoculture silo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be part of building an independent, open future.
The involves removing myself from networks that don&amp;#39;t support open standards, interoperability, and diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the principle of &amp;quot;selfdogfooding&amp;quot;, removing myself gives me the motiviation
I need to build and contribute to an alternative
&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiewebcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Indie Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the ‘corporate web’.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Buckminster Fuller, in Plain English</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2015/07/12/happy-birthday-bucky/&quot;&gt;wrote a blog post&lt;/a&gt;
to commemorate Buckminster Fuller&amp;#39;s birthday back in July,
and have now returned to his works. I am watching again
his lecture series &amp;quot;Everything I Know&amp;quot;.
There are many important messages and deep lessons in Bucky&amp;#39;s lectures that
still apply today. I am only
starting to scratch the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I watch, and follow the transcripts, I am
working on my own set of notes.
I hope by rewriting Bucky&amp;#39;s words in plain english
I can help make these lessons accessible to more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@mothersele/everything-i-know-by-buckminster-fuller-9dc49c643588&quot;&gt;first installment on Medium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/buckminsterfuller&quot;&gt;video series uploaded to archive.org&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bfi.org/about-fuller/resources/everything-i-know/session-1&quot;&gt;transcribed here&lt;/a&gt;

        <title>Session submission guidelines for conferences and camps</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week I found out that the date for my nephew&amp;#39;s christening has changed. This means I can now make it to the Drupal Camp in London. I decided to propose a session so that I can share my recent insights, research, and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Drupal Camp London team have kept the session submission process minimal. This makes it easy for people to submit proposals, but it makes it unclear what the expectations are. What are they looking for in proposed sessions? How long are the sessions expected to be? What is the review process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I only found out I could attend at the last minute, I had no time to enquire about the process. So I made some assumptions based on my experiences of programming at previous camps. I also did some research into other Drupal camp and conference session submission processes.
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/news/session-selection-drupalcon-inside-out.html&quot;&gt;Amsterdam Drupalcon site&lt;/a&gt; had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There’s a lot of elements to session selection. We need to make sure that sessions are of value to a wide audience. The presenters must be engaging speakers who can interest a large crowd of attendees. We try as hard as we can to bring in new (to DrupalCon) speakers, and speakers who bring something from outside of the Drupal sphere. We want to make sure that the diversity of the community is represented and encouraged. And we need to work across track teams to ensure that one speaker is not speaking in several tracks; both for the sake of their stress and sanity in preparing the talks and to ensure that everyone who applied has the best chance of speaking. Finally, we need to make sure that sessions fit both the theme of the track and of the conference.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.drupal.org/barcelona2015/session-submission-live&quot;&gt;Barcelona Drupalcon&lt;/a&gt; offered the following 3 part session submission formula...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 1: Describe a compelling topic that affects the reader directly, maybe a pain point, or juicy new technology. &lt;br&gt;
Part 2: Allude to your solution, sharing just enough that the reader has a moment of &amp;quot;I need that ...how do I not know this already?&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;
Part 3: Explain how awesome the session will be because you are going to cover &amp;quot;XYZ&amp;quot; and make the reader&amp;#39;s life so much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My session selection criteria&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realised that I&amp;#39;ve done session selection myself many times. At every conference, camp, and symposium I attend I make my own selection of sessions to attend. The key to making the most out of attending a conference is to attend the right sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Resonate last year I set the intention of broadening my horizons, so intentionally selected session that I would not normally be exposed to. And sessions that offered something new. At DrupalCon in Amsterdam I set the intension of getting as deep into Drupal 8 as possible. So I attended every D8 session I could. Selecting the sessions I thought offered the most opportunity for learning. It helps if they are recognisable names, or people I&amp;#39;ve seen present before and know they do a good session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I think about my own criteria, I get it down to five things...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Importance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this definitely a session worth attending? Is the session topic cutting edge, or immediately relevant to my situation. Is it ground breaking or offer a significant contribution to the field?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this the right type of session? Is the purpose of the session clear? Does the description make it clear what the expected participant outcomes are? Does the description give enough specific information to make me want to know more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the session motivated by theory, practice, and/or research? Is this presented in a detailed, thorough, and comprehensible way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Substantiated&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are all claims (practices, conclusions, proposals) well substantiated. Is the speaker presenting something they know about? Is the speaker well positioned to be giving the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Clarity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the session proposal clear? A well written session description indicates the presentation itself will be of professional quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I managed to purvey these five points in my own
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2016/01/21/survive-and-thrive-drupal-8/&quot;&gt;session proposal&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;d love to hear from you if you have your own ideas about what makes a good Drupalcamp session. If you drop me a line or leave a comment I will take them into account while planning my own session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darren&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Surviving - and thriving - during the transition to Drupal&amp;nbsp;8</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my proposal for a session at the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupalcamp.london/&quot;&gt;Drupal Camp in London&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal is going through some big changes. And, so is the world. Now may be an unsettled period, but, times of disturbance can also be times of great opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will share my experiences with Drupal and my research into how the web and society are transforming. This will include my personal manifesto and ideas about Drupal&amp;#39;s role in the future of the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Drupal community helped me transform in many ways. I have had the opportunity to work on some of the biggest, flagship Drupal websites, and in teams of all sizes. I&amp;#39;ve grown and advanced as a developer and a human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have also been difficult times. These have included my own personal challenges, and stories I have heard from others. In my work at &lt;a href=&quot;http://ideationnetworks.com/&quot;&gt;Ideation Networks&lt;/a&gt; I sit with clients as they weigh up the pros and cons of Drupal. Many organisations feel they have been burnt by Drupal. And, for some, PHP (and by association Drupal) is just not cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, on the whole, these are exciting times for Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 is the biggest achievement of our community to date. The latest version has been completely rewritten to use modern object-oriented PHP. We refer to this process as &amp;quot;getting off the island&amp;quot;. It means dropping the &amp;quot;not invented here&amp;quot; philosophy, and embracing the wider PHP community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal as a product, a community, and a movement, is our co-creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have all played a part in Drupal&amp;#39;s success: Dries and the core development team; the wider community of contributors; the attendees of Drupal camps and conferences; people who talk about Drupal; and the developers, agencies, companies and users that drive Drupal&amp;#39;s adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session I will attempt to answer these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What have we gained, and what have we sacrificed along the way?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NGOs, charities, smaller organisations, and hobbyists made up Drupal&amp;#39;s traditional user-base. Have we shunned them as we&amp;#39;ve chased the enterprise client and big budget projects? Or, does Drupal 8 bring more of these users back into the fold?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now that we&amp;#39;ve got this amazing platform, what do we do with it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Egyptian Revolution of 2011 is just one example of the web enabling real change in the world. How does Drupal fit into the bigger picture? How can we empower more positive change in the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where do we go next? How can Drupal continue to transform and grow?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is talking about front-end frameworks, progressive decoupling, big pipe, micro-services. Innovation is more than just jumping on bandwagons. Considered from a deeper place, what do these trends tell us about the real changes that are happening? How does Drupal embrace these changes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m excited. There are some tensions to resolve, and some challenges ahead, but also big opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join me for this session. Let&amp;#39;s explore transformation of our world, the web, Drupal, and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>In Summary...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Things are becoming clearer.
I wrote a bit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2015/12/03/work-in-progress/&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;
about my decision to leave Facebook.
I&amp;#39;m still exploring what this means, and here&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m at now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The most important thing about technology is how it changes people.&amp;quot;
-- Jaron Lanier&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking a lot about tech in terms of it&amp;#39;s effect on people.
Jaron Lanier, in his book
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jaronlanier.com/gadgetwebresources.html&quot;&gt;You are not a Gadget&lt;/a&gt;,
talks about the idea of &amp;quot;Lock in&amp;quot; as when a technology
becomes so established (ingrained?) that it is impossible to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see we&amp;#39;re in danger of becoming &amp;quot;locked in&amp;quot; to certain ways of thinking
about how we operate online, and by leaving Facebook I&amp;#39;m forcing myself to
think about alternatives, by necessity. By &amp;quot;opting out&amp;quot; of Facebook&amp;#39;s idea
of what it means to be connected online, I&amp;#39;m motivated to think about what
I really want and build tools for myself. Hopefully what I build will
eventually be useful for others too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://indiewebcamp.com/&quot;&gt;IndieWeb&lt;/a&gt; is a growing movement to build a people-focused alternative to the corporate web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predominant business model online now is providing &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; services, locking people in, stealing their data, and selling it to advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the web can be much more than this. But it means putting people first, rather than seeing them as just &amp;quot;data&amp;quot;. Then we can unlock the power of the web as an open platform for collaboration and cocreation, and use it to inform, to connect, and to empower.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Work in Progress: The Future of (My) Web (Part 1, Leaving Facebook)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write a post about my decision to leave Facebook (again).
It was in danger of turning into a treatise on how I see the future of the
web. So, instead, I&amp;#39;ve decided to summarise my thoughts, and post this up as a &amp;quot;Work-in-progress&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this feels a bit like déjà vu, you&amp;#39;re right. I have 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2013/12/09/create-not-consume/&quot;&gt;posted before&lt;/a&gt; about my decision to leave Facebook. 
In fact, that was almost exactly 2 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to leave. It didn&amp;#39;t work. Six months later I returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for my return was that Facebook had become
the single place where my friends organised social events.
I was locked in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB: I use the phrase &amp;quot;locked-in&amp;quot; here as a hat tip to 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jaronlanier.com/gadgetwebresources.html&quot;&gt;Jaron Lanier&lt;/a&gt;
and as a reminder to my future self to fully explain the
influence his book, You are not a Gadget, has had on my
&amp;quot;digital awakening&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I deleted my Facebook account on 10th November 2015.
This time there&amp;#39;s no going back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why will it be different this time?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the community (friendship group) that prompted my 
return to Facebook last year has since gone way past 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar&amp;#x27;s_number&quot;&gt;Dunbar&amp;#39;s number&lt;/a&gt; 
and people around me are also starting to change the way they 
use Facebook. So hopefully I wont be alone in this. 
But, I will have to make a real concerted effort to keep up with friends, 
which I hope will lead to more meaningful relationships. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I&amp;#39;m building a replacement. 
No, I&amp;#39;m not building a new Facebook. 
Let me explain...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One response I&amp;#39;ve had from people who disagree with my decision is that they could never live without Facebook. In 
particular, this tends to come from people who have family and friends scattered around the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, the truth is, Facebook doesn&amp;#39;t allow you
to do anything you couldn&amp;#39;t do before you got &amp;quot;locked in&amp;quot; to 
Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is not innovative. At least not for users. All Facebook did 
was popularise one single methodology for using the web. It created
a template into which you put yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have 1000 friends on Facebook. But, only if you 
reduce your definition of what a friend is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You define yourself using a discrete set of options, you conform to
Facebook&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;schema&amp;quot;, so you can be more easily packaged and 
sold to advertisers. I noticed Firefox put out a 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HALw5kXPeKE&quot;&gt;video on the hidden business of data&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. Kind of relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://indiewebcamp.com/monoculture&quot;&gt;monoculture&lt;/a&gt;
and that is damaging the web. 
It&amp;#39;s built by middle class white males in their 20s and 30s. 
This leads to things like 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/12/24/inadvertent-algorithmic-cruelty/&quot;&gt;Inadvertent Algorithmic Cruelty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is diverse, and the web should reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m getting distracted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was talking about building a replacement...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;IndieWeb&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I attended the Indie Web Camp in Brighton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the &#39;corporate web&#39;. 
&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;a href=&quot;http://indiewebcamp.com/&quot;&gt;IndieWeb&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I found a community of people building the web that
they want, &lt;a href=&quot;http://indiewebcamp.com/Selfdogfood&quot;&gt;Selfdogfood&lt;/a&gt; 
style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IndieWeb is about having your own website. I&amp;#39;ve pretty
much always had my own website, since I started using the 
web in the 90s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2013/12/12/how-to-be-a-cloud-survivalist-pt2/&quot;&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 about the importance of owning your own personal domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Web 1.0&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the early days of the web everyone created their own little 
space on the web.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &amp;quot;surfed&amp;quot; the web. Browsed from one site to another. 
Each site different, each site an individual expression
of creativity, each site opinionated and varied.
But now we don&amp;#39;t have variety. 
(and we&amp;#39;re in danger of not having opinion either - 
if we take all our info from Wikipedia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as the internet opens up to more of the world, 
we should be getting more diversity, not less. 
It should be getting more interesting, more opinionated,
more personal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Web 2.0&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the original dot-com bubble and collapse, 
into 2000, things look different on the web.
The &amp;quot;hype&amp;quot; of the web was over. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, Web 2.0 rose from the ashes, and offered new
opportunities, slick new designs and new business
models. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legacy of Web 2.0 is that we&amp;#39;re left with 
corporate silos and monoculture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Future web&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current accepted definition of Web 3.0 is
related to the &amp;quot;Semantic Web&amp;quot;. It brings together
ubiquitous computing, open data, and machine learning
to a point where the network becomes &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, any &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot; behaviour by the network requires 
us as humans to reduce what we think intelligence is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d rather take an optimistic view
about human potential, and then think about how the web can be used
to benefit humanity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I&#39;ve always felt that the human-centered approach to computer science leads to more interesting, more exotic, 
more wild, and more heroic adventures than the machine-supremacy approach, where information is the highest goal.
&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jaronlanier.com/&quot;&gt;Jaron Lanier&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my next steps, are to continue to eat my own dog food.
That is, to keep building my own tools, that will hopefully
eventually be useful to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s move away from the &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;lock in&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; of the current dominant
corporate silos, and work to offer new ways to 
&amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;unlock&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; the benefits technology 
can offer society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means tools for communities to cocreate. 
Tools for collaboration. And tools where individual creativity
is the default option, not conforming to a standardised 
template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can no longer follow me on Facebook, but, if you&amp;#39;re still
interested in hearing about what I&amp;#39;m up to, join 
my &amp;quot;tinyletter&amp;quot; personal newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Identity Proxy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve got 5 mins, I would really appreciate it if
you could read this. Then, tell me what you think 
of the idea.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re calling this &lt;a href=&quot;http://idproxy.co&quot;&gt;Identity Proxy&lt;/a&gt;. A bit like an 
escrow service for your contact details. 
First let me explain some of the problems we think
this solves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scenario 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re looking for an apartment. You do some online research.
You signup to several websites, services, and 
email various estate agents. You&amp;#39;ve given away your contact details
to 20 different companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You then have 20 different companies contacting you via
email, phone, SMS notifications, etc. That&amp;#39;s a lot of 
communication coming in through different channels and at
different times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You make a decision and rent a flat with one of the companies,
but 19 others have your details. What are they going to 
do with them? Sell them? Market to you later? Call you back
every few months asking if you&amp;#39;re still looking for an apartment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you could manage all this communication in once place?
Decide how and when you get contacted? And, only give your details
to the 1 company you decide to rent with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scenario 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re looking for a new job. You sign up to 10 different
recruitment websites, and job portals. 
You get a regular stream of newsletters, several per
day from different sources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve found a job you have to remember everywhere you
signed up and go around unsubscribing from each of the 
emails. Or you don&amp;#39;t and they keep filling your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you could unsubscribe from all of them at the same time, 
in one simple operation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scenario 3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re planning a holiday or a trip somewhere. You use the 
web to do research. This involves filling in lots of 
contact forms around the web while you make enquiries about
places to visit, things to do, and places to stay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re never sure who you&amp;#39;re giving your personal details
to. Are companies going to keep marketing to you? 
Will they sell your details on as a qualified &amp;quot;lead&amp;quot; to other 
companies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you could make an enquiry online and only share 
your personal details once you&amp;#39;re more comfortable with who
you&amp;#39;re doing business with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Current solutions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many sites have you signed up to in the past?
If you use a login manager or password manager, then at least you 
might have some idea of where you&amp;#39;ve given away your details, and 
what websites you&amp;#39;re registered with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&amp;#39;ve resorted to using a fake email address, or
a temporary email account? This only solves part of the 
problem, because if you&amp;#39;re expecting a reply you have to check
a separate email account. Also, many contact forms and email
services try to reject temporary email accounts because
they are often a source of spam or abuse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Identity Proxy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we take a different approach, and instead of a &amp;quot;fake&amp;quot;
temporary identity, we use a &amp;quot;verified&amp;quot; temporary identity?
The company can see you&amp;#39;re a real verified person, but 
you stay in control of what information you want to give 
away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also group enquiries and registrations into projects. 
This means that once you&amp;#39;ve found your apartment, finished
your job hunt, or returned from holiday, you can 
close your temporary identity, and shut off contact from
all the companies you sent enquiries to, or registered with.
Apart from the companies you want to continue to do business
with, who have been given your real contact details. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why we think of it as escrow for your contact details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, by grouping enquiries into projects and sending them
via the proxy, you can also decide how, and when, you want
to receive replies. This makes the communication easier to
manage, plus they can be combined into a standard
format to make it easy to compare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What about the companies?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies that are good internet citizens, and don&amp;#39;t hassle
customers, and abide by best practises should welcome this idea.
It&amp;#39;s better than receiving a fake temporary email address, because they
are assured by the verification that it is a real enquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We plan to support the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.list-unsubscribe.com/&quot;&gt;list unsubscribe header&lt;/a&gt;.
If you&amp;#39;re running a mailing list or registration system, 
you should already be implementing this on every message you send.
We are building support for this standard into our system to help companies 
keep their lists clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; That all sounds very complicated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, behind the scenes there&amp;#39;s a lot we&amp;#39;re doing to make it 
work seamlessly. But, it should be no more difficult than
sending an email, or filling in a contact form on a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no extra work involved for the person making the 
enquiries, and it will save them lots of time being able
to &amp;quot;unsubscribe&amp;quot; to a whole project group in one go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#39;s next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re going to continue development. We&amp;#39;ve started a 
website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://idproxy.co&quot;&gt;idproxy.co&lt;/a&gt; where you can 
register to be notified when we launch the service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any questions, feedback, thoughts, please get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a service you would use? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Global Startup Battle 2015 Kickoff</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at a hackathon this weekend. The Global Startup
battle to be precise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came along as a developer, excited to see what kind of
projects would be proposed, unsure what I would be
getting involved in. I didn&amp;#39;t expect to be
getting up and pitching an idea of my own...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t come expecting to pitch. In fact I was a bit
terrified of doing so. I hadn&amp;#39;t prepared, but I got up
and did it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had one minute to pitch an idea. The recommended format was:
Name, problem, solution, and who you needed for the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I see is that advertising is breaking the internet.
The current solutions of &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/turn-on-tracking-protection-in-firefox-to-make-pages-lo-1706946166&quot;&gt;tracker blocking&lt;/a&gt; in browsers, addons that
block adverts, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/the-best-ad-blockers-for-ios-9-1731433501&quot;&gt;iOS ad blockers&lt;/a&gt;
are inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can configure my browser so I never
see adverts, and I can make it harder for companies to track me,
but sometimes I like to buy stuff, and I like to know what the options
are. Sometimes I like to read content or use services, where publishers
fund themselves via advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight I used the example
of a company looking to get a website built. They send out an
RFP to agencies. The more information they give about what they
are looking for, what their situation is, and what their budget is,
the better the proposals they get, and the more informed decision
they can make. Why can&amp;#39;t we do this with all our purchasing decisions?
Rather than companies tracking us and building secret profiles,
how about we decide what data we want to share, and what our
intensions are?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue with blocking adverts across the board is
that publishers who rely on advertising income need an alternative
way of generating revenue. I don&amp;#39;t want to see them disappear if everyone
starts using adblockers. I think we can offer an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pitches were followed by time to
circulate the room and try to round up votes.
I thought it might be a process like
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idearatingsheets.org/&quot;&gt;idea rating sheets&lt;/a&gt;,
but some of the other contenders quickly set about sweeping
the room rounding up votes, while I was still trying to work
out what the protocol was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not naturally inclined to promote myself in situations like this.
So, I quietly mingled, hoping to pick up a few votes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a moment where I thought perhaps I&amp;#39;d pitched the wrong crowd.
What was I thinking?
A lot of startups build their business models based off of advertising,
and I&amp;#39;m talking about blocking ads and services that track you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people didn&amp;#39;t get it. I don&amp;#39;t blame them. I think I was a bit
confusing as I was still working out how to present my ideas.
Some people got it, but thought the
solutions were too complex to comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, amazingly, my idea got selected!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s happening!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the rest of the evening, the team formed, and we had a short
amount of time to start planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short time, the idea has transformed.
And, I&amp;#39;m excited to work on this all weekend, with this
amazing team, and see where we get to.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Survive Gentrification of the Drupal Community</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re finally approaching the release of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/node/2605142&quot;&gt;Drupal 8.0.0 on 19th Nov&lt;/a&gt;. The
biggest achievement of the Drupal community to date. A complete rewrite of the core
system to use modern object-oriented PHP. An effort that is often referred to as
&amp;quot;getting off the island&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the switch from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 is a big change for developers, it is
the result of a slow process of maturation of the Drupal community. Drupal 8
brings changes that will be welcomed by many, will bring in many new users, and of
course, will push a few people out. How can we survive this &amp;quot;gentrification&amp;quot;
of the Drupal community and prosper without losing touch with why we loved
Drupal in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gentrification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cities all over the world are becoming more exclusive, more expensive, and a
natural result of this is gentrification. It&amp;#39;s contentious. Some see this as
urban improvement, some as social cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved to London nearly 12 years ago. Dalston, to be precise. I was back in
Dalston this weekend for a party, and it&amp;#39;s very different to how I remember it
from 2004. I compared the nice clean overground train to the unreliable
and dirty Silverlink trains that used to run to Dalston. Then, walking down Kingsland
road without being on guard. When I lived there in 2004 it was often cordoned off by police.
The hipsters, the trendy coffee shops, and other obvious signs of gentrification
proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brixton was my home for many years, and I witnessed first hand the results of gentrification.
I had an office space in Brixton, and decided to
leave it when the landlord announced he was increasing the rent by 25%.
I lived in several flats around Brixton over the years, and eventually moved
(a bit) further south as rental prices in Brixton soared.
I say this with tongue in cheek, well aware that to many I&amp;#39;d be seen as one of
the gentrifiers!
It&amp;#39;s the communities that settled here during the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urban75.org/brixton/history/history.html&quot;&gt;1940s and 1950s&lt;/a&gt;
that gave the area it&amp;#39;s eclectic multi-cultural feel. They&amp;#39;re the ones who
have been displaced, losing their homes and community as developers and &amp;quot;yuppies&amp;quot;
take over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gentrification of the Drupal Community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first used Drupal back in 2003, version 4 point something. It was fun.
Hacky, but fun. I had to quickly get a site up for an event we were organising
and Drupal offered a collaborative content model that set it apart from the
other products we evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came back to Drupal in 2007 for another community site build, and Drupal 5
had been released. It was really fun. Yes, still very hacky, but it came with
the power to build a CMS exactly the way I wanted it to work, and it came with
an awesome community of other hackers. A community of dedicated open-source
types, who valued openness, and working on projects for good. I was hooked and
made the leap to full time Drupal development. Through Drupal
I got involved in the first social innovation camp, and other tech-for-good
type things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Szeged 2008 was my first Drupalcon. 500 Drupal contributors and users in a small
university town in Hungary. Everyone I met truly cared about
making Drupal an awesome project and was contributing time and effort in any
way they could. Several years later and Drupalcon have grown. 2000+ attendees in
Barcelona this year, 2300+ in Amsterdam last year. But, as the community has
grown, so has the commercial influence. With sales pitches as prevalent as
learning sessions on the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I noticed this year was that several sessions concluded, or included,
a call for donations or funding to accelerate a particular module or project&amp;#39;s
development. The precedent was set in the starting session of the conference when
the Drupal Association made an announcement about the Drupal 8 accelerate
funding programme. I&amp;#39;m not saying this is a bad thing. If this is what it
takes to get Drupal 8 finished in today&amp;#39;s conditions, then that&amp;#39;s great. But,
look at it as an indicator of how the community has changed, when compared to
the sessions at Szeged seven years earlier. You would not have seen a call for
quarter of a million dollar funding back then. Everyone was there because they
loved it, not because they were being paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hacking the hackers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While doing research for this post, I came across this brilliant essay,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/how-yuppies-hacked-the-original-hacker-ethos&quot;&gt;The hacker hacked&lt;/a&gt;,
by Brett Scott about the gentrification of hacker culture. I quote his summary
of the gentrification process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key to any gentrification process are successive waves of pioneers who gradually reduce the perceived risk of the form in question. In property gentrification, this starts with the artists and disenchanted dropouts from mainstream society who are drawn to marginalised areas. This, in turn, creates the seeds for certain markets to take root. A WiFi coffeeshop appears next to the Somalian community centre. And that, in turn, sends signals back into the mainstream that the area is slightly less alien than it used to be.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you repeat this cycle enough times, the perceived dangers that keep the property developers and yuppies away gradually erode. Suddenly, the tipping point arrives. Through a myriad of individual actions under no one person’s control, the exotic other suddenly appears within a safe frame: interesting, exciting and cool, but not threatening. It becomes open to a carefree voyeurism, like a tiger being transformed into a zoo animal, and then a picture, and then a tiger-print dress to wear at cocktail parties. Something feels ‘gentrified’ when this shallow aesthetic of tiger takes over from the authentic lived experience of tiger.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Brett Scott&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does this relate to the Drupal community? Perhaps it starts with the
NGOs and charities, our original flagship Drupal sites, that became our
&amp;quot;artists and disenchanted dropouts from mainstream society&amp;quot;. Then the
big media companies move in as the &amp;quot;perceived dangers gradually erode&amp;quot;.
Eventually, The White House start using Drupal, and we&amp;#39;re at home with the large
enterprise clients and big corporate contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Drupal project developed the requirements changed. Drupal&amp;#39;s capabilities
improve, and the Drupal user base and community advanced too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is evident in the development, and
standardisation of things like configuration management. Something that was
never an issue in the early days, as the community became more professional,
solutions for configuration management were hacked together, and then
became standardised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configuration management is just one example of the many benefits the Drupal
community has experienced through the process of gentrification. There&amp;#39;s also
great test coverage, performance improvements, greater tooling, and many other
advancements that came to Drupal as the community matured. Drupal became less
about hacking and more about software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Drupal 8&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development on Drupal 8 started in March 2011 and four years later, is to set to
be released on November 19, 2015. Over these years, Drupal has been rewritten,
removing most of the pre-OO era PHP legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal&amp;#39;s legacy was the &amp;quot;not invented here&amp;quot; mindset that became entrenched in
the community through hacking solutions to extensibility into a language that
was not designed to support it. And, a culture of not depending on third-party
code due to early well publicised security issues with PHP extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move away from this legacy, the move to &amp;quot;get off the island&amp;quot;, is a move
towards more standardised, modern, development practises, and a move to
embrace the wider PHP community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Social cleansing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned before that gentrification is contentious. For some see it as
urban improvement, some as social cleansing. Drupal and the Drupal community
have clearly benefitted already, and it looks like prosperous times ahead for
those who come along for the ride, and the newcomers who join and adopt Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, what about the social cleansing. Will parts of the community be pushed out?
Who gets left behind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal has suffered from an identity crisis. Because of it&amp;#39;s flexibility, it&amp;#39;s
been used for many things. Drupal&amp;#39;s openness to hacking, extending and ability to
do just about anything, meant it was more than just a CMS. Over the years many
talked about &amp;quot;small core&amp;quot;, many used Drupal&amp;#39;s core tools as a Framework, building
apps and tools well beyond what a typical CMS would be used for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 is a content management system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 focuses on content management, on providing tools for non-technical
users to build and manage sites. &lt;b&gt;That&amp;#39;s what it always wanted to be anyway&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 leverages the wider PHP community, in particular the Symfony
components, as it&amp;#39;s core.  It no longer makes sense to see Drupal as a
framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the parts of the community being displaced, are those using
Drupal as a framework. If this is you then you may already be looking at a fork,
like &lt;a href=&quot;https://backdropcms.org/&quot;&gt;Backdrop&lt;/a&gt;, or playing with other frameworks,
like the beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;http://laravel.com/&quot;&gt;Laravel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another section of the community that may be displaced are those running Drupal
on low end and shared hosting. Through the
gentrification process, Drupal&amp;#39;s requirements have increased.
The increased hosting requirements have meant that dedicated Drupal platform
hosting providers have emerged. More options for scalability and custom
software stacks have taken precedent over solutions for smaller websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal also potentially loses the innovators.
Drupal always had a reputation for being cutting edge and innovative.
As it moves to become the enterprise choice of open-source CMS, innovation
becomes less important, and stability, security, and backwards compatibility
become more important. The biggest innovations in Drupal (flexible content
types and Views) date back to the 4.7 era. Views is now in core in Drupal 8.
As Drupal matures further from this point, we&amp;#39;ll probably see Drupal adopting
innovations from other systems and ecosystems, rather than innovating on it&amp;#39;s own.
It&amp;#39;s well placed to do this now, built on Symfony components, innovations
from the wider community will be easier to integrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Surviving Gentrification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Do you abandon the form, leave it to the yuppies and head to the next wild frontier?
Or do you attempt to break the cycle, deface the estate-agent signs,
and picket outside the wine bar with placards reading &quot;Yuppies Go Home&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;
-- Brett Scott
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, do come along for the ride? Enjoy the benefits of gentrification, without
losing the reason why you got involved in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re going to stick around then you&amp;#39;re going to need change a few things.
Here&amp;#39;s 5 steps that will get you started:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Learn the foundations that Drupal is now built on.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If (like me) you&amp;#39;ve got a background in OO then this shouldn&amp;#39;t be too hard.
I did several years of post-graduate research into semantics and verification
of object-oriented software. You definitely don&amp;#39;t need to go that deep, but I would
highly recommend getting to grips with classic works on
design patterns such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns&quot;&gt;Gang of Four&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html&quot;&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a basic understanding of the core &amp;quot;patterns&amp;quot; of object-oriented software,
you start to appreciate how Symfony works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal, Silex, Laravel, Symfony Full Stack, Symfony CMF, phpBB, Joomla,
Magento, Piwik, PHPUnit, Sonata, and many more projects are built on this same
foundation. So, it&amp;#39;s definitely worth learning, and Drupal can be a good way
to learn it, while still working with a system you know well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try building a simple app with &lt;a href=&quot;http://silex.sensiolabs.org/&quot;&gt;Silex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpeDXSh4nHjR26Dheb6U1NUSp0aACYGvE&quot;&gt;Drupalcon&lt;/a&gt;
(and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb9XEo_1SDNR8Ucpbktrg5A&quot;&gt;Laracon&lt;/a&gt;) on
YouTube. There&amp;#39;s some great stuff. Like this talk from Ryan Weaver about
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQL1joxljho&quot;&gt;Symfony&lt;/a&gt; and
this talk by Ross Tuck about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajhqScWECMo&quot;&gt;Models and Service Layers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Do PHP the right way.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHP has changed. There&amp;#39;s a lot of outdated information and a lot of legacy code.
Drupal 8 has been rewritten to remove this legacy code, but there&amp;#39;s still a
lot of bad advice on how to write PHP out there.
Read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phptherightway.com/&quot;&gt;PHP The Right Way&lt;/a&gt; for a full guide on
how modern PHP should be crafted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Use Composer, use and create PHP packages.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting off the island, and embracing the wider PHP ecosystem means using
Composer, and it&amp;#39;s ecosystem of PHP packages. There are many more packages that
are potentially compatible with Drupal, and by architecting your Drupal
extensions as more general PHP packages you have access to a much wider
pool of potential collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating PHP packages also forces you to write clean code, think like a
software engineer, and write more maintainable, extensible, and reusable code.
Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://thephpleague.com/&quot;&gt;The PHP League&lt;/a&gt; as examples of solid
PHP packages. They have a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thephpleague/skeleton&quot;&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;
starting package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have made custom Drupal modules before. Try thinking about how you
can refactor these into separate packages, and using the Drupal &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;
as a small layer that integrates your logic with Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29&quot;&gt;SOLID&lt;/a&gt;
principles will guide you towards creating good packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Use an IDE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a big one for me. I was always against using an IDE, burnt by early
experiences with open-source IDEs. I settled on a customised Sublime Text
setup, and various other apps. I didn&amp;#39;t see much benefit over using one app
for everything when I could combine a selection of my favorite apps to do
the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure why I stuck to this. I also do a lot of C++ programming. I have
my own programming language (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cyrilcode.com&quot;&gt;Cyril&lt;/a&gt;) for creating
audio-reactive visuals. I use XCode for C++ as the debugging tools are
essential when you&amp;#39;re dealing with object graphs, memory management, and
debugging pointer issues. So, why not use an IDE for my web development?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/&quot;&gt;PHPStorm&lt;/a&gt; and it&amp;#39;s great.
Far from the cumbersome experience I had in the early days with open-source
IDEs, it offers a smooth, fast, integrated experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you can get away without an IDE when you&amp;#39;re hacking on Drupal 7, but
on an OO system like Drupal 8 you will need an IDE.
You will need the integrated tooling, testing, and you&amp;#39;ll be much more efficient
with intelligent autocompletion, hinting, quick access to docs, and fast
navigation of the huge codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Identify your values and serve your purpose.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the corporates, enterprises, and big businesses take over, it&amp;#39;s important to
remain true to your yourself.
By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_85.htm&quot;&gt;identifying your values&lt;/a&gt;
you will be well placed to notice when they are being compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably got into open-source because you believe in
the power of collaboration. But, this value of collaboration can often be at odds
with the cut-throat corporate culture of competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be aware of this is to be aware of the opportunity to spread openness and
collaboration with our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the proceeds of Drupal&amp;#39;s success flow into the community, it&amp;#39;s important to
use this to do good. To continue to serve our communities and society as a whole.
To enable collaboration, share our work, and use openness to build the world we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real opportunity, is to spread Drupal&amp;#39;s values of cooperation to the wider
population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of a bigger shift in society to adopt open-source values, principles,
and methodologies. Chris Anderson says it best:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If the past ten years have been about discovering new social and innovation models
on the Web, then the next ten years will be about applying them to the real world.&lt;br /&gt;
-- Chris Anderson
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.workopen.org/manifesto/&quot;&gt;Work Open Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; offers a useful
formulation of what it means to be open that can apply beyond open source
software: &lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;Think Big, Start Small, Work Open&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal is great case study for starting small, thinking big, and working openly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Drupal community has always has been
transforming, improving ourselves, improving the product, improving our practises,
and improving our tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;#39;s time to think beyond Drupal, beyond the Drupal community, and to see
Drupal&amp;#39;s values of collaboration, teamwork, and openness spread through the wider
community, society, and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
