<h2 class="post-title">CMSs are dead, long live CMSs</h2>

  <p class="">02 Aug 2013</p>

  </header>


            
              <p class="lead">A few people have asked me what happened to my site: is it still Drupal?
Where did the comments go? The short answer is I&#39;ve joined cool crowd and
started experimenting with static site generators, but I&#39;m going to give
you the long answer. It&#39;s a multi-faceted issue, and an excuse to finally
blog about the end of the CMS era. And, no, I&#39;m not leaving Drupal. I
still very much believe that Drupal is the best tool for a lot of
projects. I just don&#39;t want to manage my own site that way.</p>

              

<p>I&#39;ve always believed in finding the right tool for the job and over the past
six months I&#39;ve become more convinced that a CMS is not the correct tool
for simple projects (like my little website).
I don&#39;t need fancy editing tools or online administration.
In fact, I&#39;m more than happy to edit my site in my text editor of choice
(Sublime Text). I spend most of my working life inside Sublime Text, so it
makes sense for me to edit my blog here.</p>

<h2>Death of the CMS?</h2>

<p>I think we&#39;re in a post-CMS world now. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any need for
the WCMS (Web Content Management Systems) we&#39;ve become accustom to.
I&#39;m talking about the kind of web page editing CMS, like Wordpress,
Joomla, and probably most installs of Drupal. We should be thinking about
<a href="http://futurefriend.ly/">Future friendly</a> content,
structured content, mobile first, COPE (Create Once Publish Everywhere).
Content needs to be structured and needs to be flexible, and that means
we&#39;re not just editing web pages anymore. Instead we need to think about
Microdata, RDF, RSS, Web Services, mobile first, Apps, etc, and of course
whatever the future may bring. It&#39;s impossible to future-proof yourself
entirely, but with a strategic approach to content, and well defined
content model you can at least be prepared for whatever may come along
in the future. Essentially, modelling and capturing your content
without thinking about how it is displayed.</p>

<p>The second driver for this is marketing automation and full digital
platform integration. The enterprise
world is full of horrible buzzwords around WEM (Web Experience Management)
and it&#39;s clearly something that Dries is gearing up the Drupal project
for. Did you notice this in his <a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/keynote/dries-buytaert">keynote at Drupalcon Portland</a>? Dries
no longer mentions Wordpress or Joomla as competitors to Drupal, instead
he&#39;d rather talk about Adobe&#39;s CQ5, Sitecore, and Oracle&#39;s WEM.</p>

<h2>Long live the CMS</h2>

<p>So the CMS has to adapt. Drupal is already well placed to do this
because of it&#39;s flexibility and existing ecosystem of integrations,
and Drupal 8 brings us even closer putting web services at the core
of Drupal.</p>

<p>The end result of this though is that CMS become much more complicated
beasts than they already are if they want to remain relevant and useful.
This puts them out of reach for a lot of people, and there&#39;s a lot of
simple projects that don&#39;t need all these features. That&#39;s where the static site generators join the party.</p>

<p>I think in this post-CMS world, systems either join the big leagues and
get enterprise features, or they simplify and become tools for quickly
building sites.</p>

<p>For my blog I&#39;ve gone with the latter. A simple tool that just generates
static web pages from a template.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>The decision to change my site was motivated by several things:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>My old site wasn&#39;t mobile friendly</strong>. I can hardly go around telling people about the importance of mobile when my own site looks shit when viewed on anything other than a desktop or laptop!</li>
<li><strong>The comments were really low quality</strong>. I had a handful of good comments but the rest added nothing of value. I also had to pre-moderate everything because of the huge amount of spam. Apologies to the few people who had left really good comments - you know who you are. I&#39;ll send a prize to the best and I might repost some of the good ones as updates to the articles.</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>, there&#39;s nothing faster than serving static files! That makes it easier and cheaper to run. Apparently there&#39;s SEO benefits of having a fast site too! ;)</li>
<li><strong>There was too much bloat</strong>. In the words of Brad Frost: <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/death-to-bullshit-at-creative-mornings/">Death to bullshit!</a>. Actually, I did some comparisons, let me elaborate...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bloat</h2>

<p>I took the text of some articles from my site and gzipped them (because my web server does that too before sending). An average article came out at 7kB when zipped. When viewed as part of my old Drupal-based site it came out at 14.4kB, and when you include downloading the CSS, JS, etc it would be 158.6kB. Wow, 158k for a 7k article!</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not the worst offender. I tried some random other sites. For example CNET, a 1.2kB article resulted in a 18.1kB HTML source, and 1.3MB total download for a single page. On the BBC News website a 758 byte article (tiny!) came out at 71kB HTML source, and 501.5kB for the whole page.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pleased to say this new site, for the same 7kB article, comes out at about 50kB with all the CSS, images and JS. that&#39;s less than a third, and most of that is the PNG of my smiley face! :)</p>

<h2>Middleman</h2>

<p>I played around with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> initially but
I found <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> to be much more flexible. Plus, Middleman is what we&#39;re using for prototyping responsive
designs and quickly building mockups.</p>

<p>Basically, you give your files two extensions, what you want it to be, and what it is, then Middleman watches the files and translates them as needed.
For example, if you&#39;ve got a <code>style.css.scss</code> file then Middleman converts it from SASS into CSS. I&#39;m writing my blog posts in files like <code>2013-08-02-new-blog.html.md</code> and it&#39;s converting them from markdown to HTML.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve also got loads of cool preprocessing stuff like partials, and
you can use Ruby templates, Rack plugins for your asset pipeline, and
deploy your website with just one command: <code>middleman deploy</code></p>

<p>There&#39;s a load of contributed modules that add on extra functionality. It comes with a blogging module that adds some nice features for managing a blog.</p>

<h2>Migration</h2>

<p>I wrote a very simple Drush command that output the content from my blog to a set of flat files. I could just render the nodes and save them as HTML because Middleman can use that as a post format. I&#39;ve switched to using Markdown for future posts, but it doesn&#39;t matter that the old posts are in HTML.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I can edit my blog posts in the text editor (Sublime Text) where I spend most of my life. I can easily preview edits (with Live Reload, nice!), and then build and deploy updates in just one command. The server does very little work to serve the pages, and it&#39;s very cacheable. I could even now move my site to being served by GitHub Pages or similar.</p>

<p>A static site generator is a good idea for simple web projects. CMSs
are adapting, and Drupal is preparing to take on big enterprise projects.</p>
