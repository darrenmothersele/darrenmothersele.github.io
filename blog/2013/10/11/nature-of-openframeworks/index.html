  <h1>Nature of openFrameworks (part 1)</h1>

<p>The excellent, self-published, book <a href="http://natureofcode.com/">
The Nature of Code</a> by Daniel Shiffman gives a solid foundation for
understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world. There
are loads of great examples that show programming techniques for simulating
the natural world in code.</p>

<!--break-->
<p>The book is written to target Processing, a popular Java based creative
coding framework. Because I prefer C++, and in order to familiarise myself
more with openFrameworks, I’ve been converting some of the examples to work
in openFrameworks. Here are some of the early examples, I may post more,
but I’ve started looking at Cinder too, so in future I may convert some examples to
Cinder instead.</p>

<p>Click each title to access the code on Gist:</p>

<h3 id="a-hrefhttpsgistgithubcomdarrenmothersele6934845random-walkera"><a href="https://gist.github.com/darrenmothersele/6934845">Random Walker</a></h3>

<p>This is the first example from the introduction. It just moves a point around
the screen randomly. There is no <code>point()</code> method in openFrameworks so to draw
a single pixel we just draw a 1x1 rectangle.</p>

<p>The App class just needs a variable to store an instance of the Walker:</p>

<p>The <code>step()</code> and <code>display()</code> methods are both called from within Processing’s
draw loop, but in openFrameworks we use the <code>update()</code> method to update state
separately from the draw loop.</p>

<p>Finally, the main file to launch the openFrameworks app.</p>

<h3 id="a-hrefhttpsgistgithubcomdarrenmothersele7875888random-number-distributiona"><a href="https://gist.github.com/darrenmothersele/7875888">Random number distribution</a></h3>

<p>This example shows how random numbers are evenly distributed.</p>

<p>There’s no method for finding the array length in C++ so we hard code the
length of the array used to store the count of the generated random numbers.
You can find the length of a simple array (not an array of pointers) using
the <code>sizeof()</code> function, by dividing the size of the array by the size of
each element, like this: <code>(sizeof(a)/sizeof(*a))</code> or preferably use a container
class like std::vector which will be covered later.</p>

<h3 id="a-hrefhttpsgistgithubcomdarrenmothersele7875908gaussian-distributiona"><a href="https://gist.github.com/darrenmothersele/7875908">Gaussian distribution</a></h3>

<p>In Processing you have to clear the screen each time in the draw loop, but
openFrameworks does this for you by default. To disable this you add a call
to <code>ofSetBackgroundAuto(false)</code> in setup. To create the alpha background
effect I draw a rectangle over the whole screen area. Here’s a version that
uses a complete random distribution:</p>

<p>And here is a version using a Gaussian distribution. openFrameworks doesn’t have
the Gaussian function is in the Random utility class in Processing, so we have
to specify a function to calculate the next Gaussian number:</p>

<h3 id="a-hrefhttpsgistgithubcomdarrenmothersele7875928custom-distribution-monte-carloa"><a href="https://gist.github.com/darrenmothersele/7875928">Custom distribution (Monte Carlo)</a></h3>

<p>Here’s an example that demonstrates a custom distribution.</p>

<h3 id="a-hrefhttpsgistgithubcomdarrenmothersele7875942perlin-noisea"><a href="https://gist.github.com/darrenmothersele/7875942">Perlin Noise</a></h3>

<p><code>ofNoise</code> is the openFrameworks equivalent of Processing’s <code>noise()</code> function.
It returns a float between 0 and 1. openFrameworks also has an equivalent of
map function (<code>ofMap</code>) that maps the noise value (which is 0 - 1) to the
range 0 - height.</p>
