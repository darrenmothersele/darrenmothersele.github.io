<p>I have revised and improved the training in preparation for DrupalCamp next week. I’ve incorporated some feedback, added a bit of theory, and included more practical examples. Join me and level up your PHP development skills in this 1 day course.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Build Your Own PHP Framework.</p>

<p>Learn modern PHP practices and see the benefits first hand via practical examples. Learn object oriented design and how to apply design patterns.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of old PHP code and information around on the web. With the massive improvements in PHP in recent years, a lot of this information is wrong and out of date. In this course I will be focusing on only modern, state of the art PHP.</p>

<p>Moving from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 means adopting modern, object-oriented, PHP practices. Drupal 8 has gone through a process of “getting off the island” and embracing the wider PHP ecosystem. We, as PHP developers using Drupal, can improve our own processes by doing the same.</p>

<p>Building your own framework is a great way to learn the fundamentals of modern PHP. Regardless of your choice of framework, this will make you a better developer. A similar foundation of components underlies Drupal, Symfony, Silex, and Lavavel.</p>

<p>Details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn framework decoupling techniques.</li>
  <li>Write better code by avoiding unnecessary complexity.</li>
  <li>Use Domain Driven Design to tackle complexity and design better solutions.</li>
  <li>Go beyond MVC and start to explore other design patterns such as command bus and repositories.</li>
  <li>Learn simple strategies you can immediately apply to develop better code.</li>
  <li>Understand the components at the core of Drupal 8, many other PHP frameworks and popular PHP apps.</li>
  <li>Digestible 40 minute sections interspersed with practical workshop where you get hands-on experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need a basic knowledge of PHP and a laptop that can run PHP. You will leave with a better understanding of the principles behind modern PHP and Drupal 8.</p>
