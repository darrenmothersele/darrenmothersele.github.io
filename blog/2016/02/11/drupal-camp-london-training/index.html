<p>I’m excited to announce that I’ll be back running training at this year’s Drupal Camp in London. This will be the 3rd year in a row that I’ve offered training at the camp. I’m doing something a bit different this time…</p>

<h2 id="build-your-own-php-framework">Build Your Own PHP Framework</h2>

<p>In this training you will build your own PHP framework.</p>

<p>But, why reinvent the wheel?</p>

<p>Building your own framework is a great way to learn the fundamentals of modern PHP. Regardless of your choice of framework, this will make you a better developer. A similar foundation of components underlies Drupal, Symfony, Silex, and Lavavel.</p>

<p>If you are a developer going from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 then you need to adopt an object-oriented mindset.</p>

<p>Drupal doesn’t always get it right. If you understand the basic principles you know when and why you’re breaking them. You can make pragmatic choices as a programmer, without embodying bad practices.</p>

<p>“Build Your Own Framework” is a fun training to learn modern PHP. You will learn the “SOLID” principles of PHP package design. The training will demystify dependency injection, hexagonal architecture and other design patterns. We will look at HTTP Foundation and the other Symfony components.</p>

<p>Come armed with a basic knowledge of PHP, a laptop that can run PHP, and an open mind. Leave with a better understanding of the principles behind modern PHP and Drupal 8.</p>
