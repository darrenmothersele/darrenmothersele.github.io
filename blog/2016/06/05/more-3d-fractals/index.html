<p>This is one of my most recent creations…</p>

<div>
<a href="/img/fractals/13.png"><img src="/img/fractals/13sm.jpg" /></a>
</div>

<p>I created that image above with a program called Mandelbulb 3D. 
It includes many fractal equations, including the 3D version of the
famous Mandelbrot set, the Mandelbulb. </p>

<p>I found it hard at first to get anything interesting out of 
Mandelbulb, so I went off on an exploration of fractal geometry.
I figured I’d be able to get better results if I knew the theory
behind what the equations were doing, rather than just randomly 
combining fractal equations and randomly tweaking parameters. </p>

<p>I started with the Mandelbrot set, like most 
people who start experimenting with fractals. I quickly moved on to some simple iterated functions. My very first experiments were with some equations I found in 
an old book “Symmetry in Chaos” by Michael Field and Martin Golubitsky.</p>

<a href="/img/fractals/06.png"><img src="/img/fractals/06tm.jpg" /></a>
</div>

<p>I combined this method of plotting the images, with 
fractal equations, and it mainly went wrong. 
Some of the wrong images actually looked quite interesting…</p>

<div>
<a href="/img/fractals/09.png"><img src="/img/fractals/09tm.jpg" /></a>
</div>

<p>Eventually, I accidentally came up with this:</p>

<div>
<a href="/img/fractals/08.jpg"><img src="/img/fractals/08sm.jpg" /></a>
</div>

<p>It was actually a black and white render, but I’ve applied some fake colouring. 
I thought it looked a bit “spacey”, so I sampled colours from a 
universe photo. </p>

<p>Going back to Mandelbulb, my search for interesting fractal combinations
was much more fruitful. Some of my discoveries are below. </p>

<p>In the beginning, I was using fog to emphasise depth. In some
cases I think I overdid it…</p>

<div>
<a href="/img/fractals/01.jpg"><img src="/img/fractals/01tm.jpg" /></a>
</div>

<p>I think the most “realistic” images have come from
using colours sampled from real photos. The hardest part
of creating this next image was getting the camera angle right. 
I think the sampled colours make it look almost like a real
forest scene. Natural colours (sampled from real photos) tend to be much more 
desaturated than the colours picked manually…</p>

<div>
<a href="/img/fractals/02.jpg"><img src="/img/fractals/02tm.jpg" /></a>
</div>

<p>This was my first experiment with combining two fractal formulas. 
Rather than alternating multiple formulas to create a combined 
geometry, you can visualise the output of two formulas, if you can align 
them correctly…</p>

<div>
<a href="/img/fractals/03.jpg"><img src="/img/fractals/03tm.jpg" /></a>
</div>

<p>This one has a grainy look because I reduced the quality to 
speed up the rendering process. 
I thought it looked a bit like a jellyfish, so I added some 
colours to make it look like it was underwater. 
Unfortunately, when I increased the quality to create the 
final render it lost it’s form. So, here’s the grainy version…</p>

<p>This next one might be my favourite so far. 
Click to see full version. I really like the 
shading on the “moon” in the background…</p>
