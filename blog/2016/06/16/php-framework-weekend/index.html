  <h1>PHP Framework in One Weekend</h1>

<p>Earlier this year I set about creating a day of training for 
DrupalCamp London. It was based on a PHP Framework
course I’d given, but reduced to fit into a day. 
We ended up focusing on Modern PHP, as that was most useful for the
attendees in their transition from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8.</p>

<p>It was a really successful day, and I had some great feedback. 
I have since developed the idea into a two day training course,
which looks at some of the core concepts behind most modern PHP apps.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of months I have worked hard to refine the 
content and edit it down into a short guide. I’ve released it
(thanks to <a href="https://leanpub.com/phpframework">Leanpub</a>)
in the form of a book. It guides the reader through a 
weekend-long project to construct a simple PHP web framework.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“a weekend, the fundamental unit of coding self-improvement” 
- Peter Shirley</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In particular, it uses Symfony Components, and some other popular
PHP packages, to demonstrate the core features of
web frameworks, like routing, templating, controllers, and 
dependency injection. Projects such as Drupal, phpBB, Laravel, eZ Publish, Joomla!, Magento, Piwik, and many more are using Symfony Components as a foundation on which to build. The book uses these, and more, to build our own PHP Framework
in a weekend.</p>

<p>Here’s the full contents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Getting Started</li>
  <li>Managing Complexity</li>
  <li>Testing</li>
  <li>HTTP</li>
  <li>Templating</li>
  <li>Content</li>
  <li>Routing</li>
  <li>Controllers</li>
  <li>Dependency Injection</li>
  <li>Design and Layout</li>
  <li>Reuse</li>
</ul>
