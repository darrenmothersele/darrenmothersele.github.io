  <h1>Tiny PHP Micro-Framework in 40 Lines of Code</h1>

<p>I’m working on a project that needs a very simple backend.
The app will only have a handful of users, and the frontend
interface has been built in Angular 2. The backend is mainly 
a proxy, with a bit of added configuration.</p>

<p>Drupal 8, with it’s built in support for REST(ish) services,
could be an option for modern web apps built with Angular 2.
But, in this case, Drupal would have definitely been overkill.
Perhaps <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> (Node.js) could have 
been an option, or any of the multitude of PHP 
Micro-frameworks. But this seemed like a good excuse to
play with some modern PHP, and build something minimal.</p>

<p>As this project just needed a simple proxy to a third-party API
to add in some configuration and cache some things, it could
have been done in a single PHP script. But, this is modern
PHP - so we’re going to try and do things a bit neater than 
that. We know that <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">easy is not always simple</a>.
I want to keep this simple, which is not necessarily the
easiest option. The most important rule to follow here is
the <strong>single responsibility principle</strong>. Each file will
contain just one class, each class with encapuslate one thing,
and each block of code will have a single responsibility. 
I may blog about other interesting parts of this app in 
the future, but for now let’s just look at the core
of the app.</p>

<p>Here’s the code in it’s entirety. The astute among you may
recognise this as a middleware dispatcher, like <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim</a>,
<a href="http://stackphp.com/">Stack</a>, or <a href="http://relayphp.com/">Relay</a>…</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>use DI\InvokerInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;

class StackRunner
{
    /** @var InvokerInterface */
    protected $invoker;

    protected $stack = [];
    protected $current = 0;

    public function __construct(InvokerInterface $invoker, $stack)
    {
        $this-&gt;invoker = $invoker;
        $this-&gt;stack = $stack;
    }

    public function __invoke(ServerRequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response)
    {
        if (!isset($this-&gt;stack[$this-&gt;current])) {
            return $response;
        }

        $middleware = $this-&gt;stack[$this-&gt;current];
        $this-&gt;current++;

        return $this-&gt;invoker-&gt;call($middleware, [
          'request' =&gt; $request,
          'response' =&gt; $response,
          'next' =&gt; $this,
        ]);
    }
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That’s it. Less than 40 lines of code.</p>

<p>There’s another <em>no-framework</em> implementation called 
<a href="https://github.com/woohoolabs/harmony">Harmony</a> that takes a similar
approach. It’s also very small at 200 lines. I think 
this minimal version above, less than a quarter of the size, is
useful because it’s so simple. But, it might not be obvious 
at first glance what it’s doing. Let’s break it down, look 
at how it works, and how to use it.</p>

<p>The website for <a href="http://stackphp.com/">StackPHP</a> has a diagram that 
shows how the middleware dispatcher idea works. They refer to this as an onion.</p>

<p><strong>NB</strong>: Ignore the session layer. I’m building a restful API, and restful
APIs should not have state. One of the six constraints for a REST 
architecture is statelessness. I wont go into this now, but save
this for a future blog post.</p>

<p>In this model you build up a <em>stack</em> of middleware, then pass the request 
through each one, then pass the response back out through each layer. 
Each layer in the stack gets to process the request and response as they
travel into the core of the app, and then back out again. 
In my actual app I have layers that deal with CORS, JWT Authentication, 
Exception Handling, Firewall, Logging, Routing to the correct controller,
and JSON formatting. Everything is nicely separated into layers that deal with a single 
step of the process.</p>

<p>The core of the app is your business logic. Everything is separated
into layers, and each can be tested and reasoned about in isolation.</p>

<p>The stack of middleware is injected into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">StackRunner</code>
as a dependency via the constructor, along with an instance
of an implementation of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">InvokerInterface</code>.
In my case I’m using <a href="http://php-di.org/">PHP-DI</a> as a dependency injection container
and it’s container implements the required interface. 
The interface provides a <code class="highlighter-rouge">call()</code> method that given a 
PHP callable (or string registered in the container) 
instantiates the callable (if required) and uses the container
to provide any arguments.</p>

<p>This <code class="highlighter-rouge">StackRunner</code> class produces an invokable object. When invoked
the stack of middleware is traversed, executing each one (via the <code class="highlighter-rouge">InvokerInterface</code> object)
and passing itself along, so that execution can continue.
The implementation of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">__invoke()</code> method does this
and has just 3 simple sections:</p>

<p>1) First it checks to see if it has reached the end of the stack
of middlware. In which case it just returns the current
<code class="highlighter-rouge">$response</code> so that it can travel back up the stack.</p>

<p>2) If not at the end of the stack, the current middleware
is retrieved from the stack and the stack pointer 
(<code class="highlighter-rouge">$this-&gt;current</code>) is moved along to the next middleware.</p>

<p>3) The InvokerInterface is used to call the middleware,
passing in the <code>$request</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">$response</code>, and the
stack runner as <code class="highlighter-rouge">$next</code> so that it can be called
from within the middleware to continue execution along
the rest of the stack.</p>

<p>So, how do you make use of this?</p>

<p>Well, you need a few things to make it work.
As you can see in the code above, it’s programmed against
interfaces from PSR-7. This is the PHP-FIG (Framework
Interoperability Group) effort to standardise the
Request and Response object interfaces. 
Any implementation of PSR-7 will do, for example
the Diactoros package from Zend.</p>

<p>You also need to register your dependencies with 
a PHP-DI container and provide that to the constructor.
Here’s an example of how it might be used:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$stack = [ExampleMiddleware::class];
$builder = new ContainerBuilder;
$builder-&gt;addDefinitions($config);
$container = $builder-&gt;build();
$runner = new StackRunner($container, $stack);
$response = $runner($request, $response);
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>So what does a middleware in this stack look like?</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class ExampleMiddleware
{
    public function __invoke($request, $response, $next)
    {
        // 1. optionally do something with $request

        // 2. continue execution down the stack
        $response = $next($request, $response);

        // 3. optionally do something with $response

        // 4. return $response
        return $response;
    }
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can add type hints to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">__invoke</code> method. I left
them off here for brevity. When invoked, the middleware
receives the request and response. It can process these,
call the next middleware (via the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$next</code> callable provided),
then it <strong>must</strong> return a response object.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">InvokerInterface</code> it’s possible to use the 
DI container to instantiate the middleware to provide
dependencies.</p>

<p>By using a middleware stack runner like this you can 
easily get separation of concerns and make your code simpler.
For simple tasks a PHP framework can be overkill. You can 
get a long way with a clean design by using a dependency injection
container to instantiate your objects, and a layered calling
mechanism like this. Your code will be more testable,
maintainable, and reusable. And, you can get to working on the
core domain of the problem without worrying about framework 
or CMS issues. Rather than trying to fit your solution into
the constraints of a framework, you can build your solution
in the most appropriate way, deal with any complexities in the domain
logic up front, and then wrap it up as required.</p>
