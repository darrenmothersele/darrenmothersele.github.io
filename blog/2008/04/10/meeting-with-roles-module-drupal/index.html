  <h1>Meeting With Roles - Module for Drupal</h1>

<p>I couldn't get the available event content types or CCK to do what I wanted, so I've made a simple meeting module for Drupal that allows you to create a number of meeting templates with various roles, and then create meetings on specific dates, with users assigned to each of the roles.</p>

<!--break-->
<p>There are tons of different ways to create events using Drupal, and I was previously using CCK and user-reference fields to do this, but I wanted some more flexibility and came up with this.</p>
<p>What I need to do was have a pre-defined meeting template, in which various members of the community perform different roles at a meeting. For example member x might be the chairperson and member's y and z might be speakers. I could set up events using the Date API and Date CCK fields and User Reference fields. Some roles had an extra field (such as speech title for a speaker). I created a content type using CCK that did all of this without too much difficulty. </p>
<p>But, then, if I needed to change the meeting template - I couldn't do so without affecting all the previous meetings, unless I created a new content type using CCK. This starts to get a pain, and it's not something I could delegate to someone without knowledge of CCK or Views.</p>
<p>The solution was to create a new module, that had a simple interface for creating a meeting template with various roles, and auto-lookup user fields. At any time you can create a new template, and change the current active template. This only changes the template for newly created nodes - as all old templates are remembered for the correct presentation of previous meetings.</p>
<p>If you need to create a meeting content type, or create events in your Drupal site that may have multiple roles, then this module may be of use to you too.</p>
<p>You can download the code below. I have only tested this with version 5.7 of the Drupal core.</p>
<p>The basic usage is as follows:</p>
<p>- install the module</p>
<p>- configure a meeting template, and then set this as the active template.</p>
<p>- create a meeting. You can now add users to your meeting and assign them specific roles.</p>
<p>I have some code to put a users upcoming and previous roles on their profile. I will be merging that code into this module.</p>
<p>Let me know if you find this useful.</p>
