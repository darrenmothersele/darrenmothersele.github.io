  <h1>Heartbleed</h1>

<p>A <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">serious bug in OpenSSL</a> was disclosed last night.
I just happened to check
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7548991">Hacker News</a> late last night,
about 2 hours after it had been posted.</p>

<p>Luckily, by this time Ubuntu had released updated packages for OpenSSL, and
as most of the servers under my control are running Ubuntu Server, I could
easily patch them to remove the vulnerability. The fix for RedHad seemed to
take a little bit longer to arrive, but it’s
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/site/solutions/781793">here now</a>.</p>

<p>Patching the vulnerability is just the first step, there’s a lot more work to
do to recover from this bug…</p>

<!--break-->

<h3 id="check-openssl-version">Check OpenSSL version</h3>

<p>You need to be running <strong>OpenSSL 1.0.1g</strong></p>

<pre><code>openssl version
</code></pre>

<p>Just running this command doesn’t report back full version information.
If you check <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/587324/heartbleed-how-to-reliably-and-portably-check-the-openssl-version">this post</a> you will find further information on what to look for.</p>

<p>If you are on Ubuntu 12.04 the package you are looking for is this one:</p>

<pre><code>openssl 1.0.1-4ubuntu5.12
</code></pre>

<h3 id="further-recovery">Further recovery…</h3>

<p>But, patching OpenSSL is only a small part of the fix for this bug.
The consequences of this are much deeper.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Heartbleed bug allows anyone on the Internet to read the memory of
the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software.
- <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This essentially means that encryption keys, user credentials, and any
content handled by the servers could have been exposed. So the following
steps are required (see <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/55075/does-heartbleed-mean-new-certificates-for-every-ssl-server">this post</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Revocation of the old keypairs that were just superseded</li>
  <li>Changing all passwords</li>
  <li>Invalidating all session keys and cookies</li>
  <li>Evaluating the actual content handled by the vulnerable servers that could have been leaked, and reacting accordingly.</li>
  <li>Evaluating any other information that could have been revealed, like memory addresses and security measures</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="leaves-no-trace">Leaves no trace…</h3>

<p>It’s also worth noting that exploiting the vulnerability leaves no trace, so
there is no way to know if your system, encryption keys, passwords or content
has been compromised.</p>

<p>It’s worth doing a general password reset anyway.</p>

<p>Final note, it’s worth pointing out that this doesn’t affect OpenSSH, just OpenSSL,
as OpenSSH doesn’t include the broken TLS implementation.</p>
