  <h1>Everything I know about Drupal in 2 days</h1>

<p>Right now, there is no more efficient way of building sites than using
Drupal 7.  At its core a stable CMS framework, and with
a few solid ‘API’ modules from contrib-land, it offers everything you need
to quickly build out functionality required for most websites in a flexible
and easily customisable way.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Advanced Drupal site-building, combined with best-practises from the world of
front-end design, means you can also easily tame Drupal’s output and
create stunning designs. And, with a few UI tweaks to finish it off you can
craft luxurious and smart user experiences…</p>

<p>…This is Drupal at it’s best.</p>

<p>###Training?</p>

<p>Would you like to join me as I cover everything I know about Drupal in 2 days?
It’s going to be intensive, so you’ll need a little bit of exposure to
Drupal before (or be a very enthusiastic beginner) in order to get the best out
of it.</p>

<p>I mentioned that I was doing some training on Twitter, and a couple of
people very kindly commented…</p>

<p>OK, so I can’t really cover everything I know about Drupal in just 2
days, but I will cover enough material that I guarantee everyone will
get something out of it. Give me 2 days, and I can help you build better Drupal
websites! :)</p>

<p>###Current State of the Art</p>

<p>In this training you will learn effective techniques for evaluating the various options Drupal gives you. We look at how to design novel solutions using Drupal’s building blocks, and look at some typical requirements and various ways they can be tackled with Drupal.</p>

<p>The intensive 2 day training course will provide helpful advice, tips, tricks and best practises for any level of Drupal professional wanting to work more efficiently and create better websites by truly understanding what’s going on inside Drupal and the most popular contributed modules.</p>

<p>###Some of the topics covered</p>

<ul>
  <li>Architecting Drupal sites</li>
  <li>Advanced configurations with Views, Rules, Display Suite, Context, and Panels.</li>
  <li>Dealing with rich content and media in secure and scalable ways</li>

</ul>

<p>###Who’s it for?</p>

<p>This training came about due to encouraging feedback from the
introductory course given at Drupal Camp London.
The course is aimed at intermediate site-builders
(or beginners with a lot of enthusiasm) who want to
understand the various options in order to make better
architectural decisions when building sites with Drupal.</p>
