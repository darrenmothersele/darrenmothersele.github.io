    <p class="lead"><p>A few people have asked me what happened to my site: is it still Drupal?
Where did the comments go? The short answer is I&#39;ve joined cool crowd and
started experimenting with static site generators, but I&#39;m going to give
you the long answer. It&#39;s a multi-faceted issue, and an excuse to finally
blog about the end of the CMS era. And, no, I&#39;m not leaving Drupal. I
still very much believe that Drupal is the best tool for a lot of
projects. I just don&#39;t want to manage my own site that way.</p>

    <p class="lead"><p>I presented yesterday at the July edition of the &quot;Untangle the Web&quot; meetup
being held at the Google Campus in London.
When I was invited to speak, I was asked to give an introductory talk about
Drupal and what kind of things it&#39;s good for. To do this, I decided to talk
about how I was introduced to Drupal, how it&#39;s developed over the years,
metadata and future-friendly content, and a preview of what&#39;s coming in
the next version of Drupal.</p>

    <p class="lead"><p>My preferred setup for running Drupal sites uses Nginx, PHP-FPM and MariaDB. After reading a few posts about issues with Drupal 8 in this setup, I decided to quickly test it using Vagrant. I managed to get a development version of Drupal 8 up and running in approximately 30 mins in which I tried various things to get it working. Here are the steps that worked.

    <p class="lead"><p>Drupal is a good choice as a platform for building web apps thanks to devops advances that work around PHP's inadequacies as a modern programming language. Web app builders can benefit from the extensive ecosystem of Drupal modules, and the unrivalled community support, while still complying (almost) with the best practises for web apps set out in the Twelve Factor web app methodology.</p>

    <p class="lead"><p>The ketogenic diet. If you look around you&#39;ll find loads of info about it used
to treat epilepsy in children. That was until they discovered the drugs. Drugs
are easier to administer than a diet so they switched to using them, despite the
fact that the diet is probably more effective and safer!</p>

<p><a href="http://som.unm.edu/coc/docs/Ketodiet_eng_10Dec09.pdf">Ketogenic diet</a>
involves putting your body into ketosis. You get energy from ketones instead of
glucose. If you&#39;re producing ketones then your body is using fat for energy,
instead of using sugar (glucose) and storing the fat instead.</p>

<p>In the book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fat-Chance-bitter-truth-about/dp/0007514123
">Fat Chance</a>, by a leading endocrinologist, it is argued that hormones play a
vital role in all this. It covers the effects of insulin, leptin, and to some extent cortisol.
You could say Fat Chance is an update of
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pure-White-And-Deadly-killing/dp/0241965284">Pure White and Deadly</a>.</p>

<p>Fat Chance was
<a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587%2813%2970024-X/fulltext">
reviewed by The Lancet medical journal</a>, who said:</p>

<blockquote>"I fear that the serious messages and issues raised by this book are
in danger of being dismissed by the way the message is delivered."</blockquote>

<p>So ignoring the americanised, self-helpy, writing style, that book basically
explains the whole process of how insulin/leptin works in the body and how
sugar fucks everything up.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-We-Get-Fat-about/dp/0307949435">
Why We Get Fat: And What to Do about It</a> by Gary Taubes is another good
book on the subject.</p>

<p>I started putting MCT (medium chain triacylglycerols) oil in my coffee. There&#39;s
quite a bit of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11694608">research</a>
(and <a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/132/3/329.full">here</a>) about them,
but basically I think replacing some of your fat intake with MCT oil shifts the balance
of fat in your diet away from LCT to MCT which helps break down fat in your body.
I&#39;m not sure exactly how MCT oil works, but I did find that it makes you feel
fuller for longer so you actually don&#39;t want to eat as much.</p>

<p>Giving up carbs is hard, and I got headaches for a couple of weeks, but I felt much
better and less lethargic while I was doing it. Just thinking about this again is making
me want to get back into it... the only downside is it&#39;s hard.</p>

<p>Who would have thought eating pork scratchings could ever get boring?!?</p>

<p>But it did work. I lost 2 stone in under 2 months, and I kept the weight off
after I started re-introducing carbs back into my diet.</p>

<p>So, in terms of macro-nutrients, I switched towards Protein and Fat, reducing
carbohydrate intake. I used the values in <a href="http://aaron.emascc.com/diet/ebooks/Lyle_McDonald_-_The_Ketogenic_Diet.pdf">this guide</a> to try and work out how much I should be getting. But, in real life I just tried to eat less than 20g of carb per day. I found
the balance between protein and fat by experimenting. I started eating too much
protein and not enough fat. That gave me headaches so I had to increate the amount
of fat in my diet. Once I got the balance between fat and protein right the headaches went away.</p>

<p>With your macro-nutrient intake sorted then theoretically you should get the
micro-nutrients you need too. But, because of modern farming methods,
transportation, and loads of other factors, we don&#39;t get all the micro-nutrients
we need from our food. So, you need to supplement. For example, almost everyone
in the western world has a vitamin D deficiency.
I took quite a high dosage of extra vitamin D, about 5000 IU/day.</p>

<p>Final tip, do anything you can to increase your levels of glutathione. This one
is hard because your digestive system destroys it so it&#39;s hard to just take it as a supplement.
<a href="http://www.abundanceandhealth.co.uk/products/101-altrient-lypo-spheric-gsh-glutathione-livon-labs.aspx">This lypo-spheric</a> suppliment was the only version I found that worked for me but I had to stop taking it because it&#39;s so expensive. I now take <a href="http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-1018-N-ACETYL%20CYSTEINE.aspx?activeIngredientId=1018&activeIngredientName=N-ACETYL%20CYSTEINE">NAC (N-acetyl cysteine)</a>, which is a precursor to glutathione. I.e. your body uses NAC in the synthesis of glutathione, so if there&#39;s more of that in your body, it&#39;s easier to make more glutathione.</p>

<p>P.s. Drink loads of water.</p>

This is a write up of the notes I made and thoughts I had during the weekend. All the sessions were recorded and should be online soon.  </p>
