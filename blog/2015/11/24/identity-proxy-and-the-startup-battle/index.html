  <h1>Identity Proxy</h1>

<p>If you’ve got 5 mins, I would really appreciate it if
you could read this. Then, tell me what you think 
of the idea.  </p>

<!--break-->

<p>We’re calling this <a href="http://idproxy.co">Identity Proxy</a>. A bit like an 
escrow service for your contact details. 
First let me explain some of the problems we think
this solves:</p>

<h2 id="scenario-1">Scenario 1</h2>

<p>You’re looking for an apartment. You do some online research.
You signup to several websites, services, and 
email various estate agents. You’ve given away your contact details
to 20 different companies. </p>

<p>You then have 20 different companies contacting you via
email, phone, SMS notifications, etc. That’s a lot of 
communication coming in through different channels and at
different times.</p>

<p>You make a decision and rent a flat with one of the companies,
but 19 others have your details. What are they going to 
do with them? Sell them? Market to you later? Call you back
every few months asking if you’re still looking for an apartment?</p>

<p>What if you could manage all this communication in once place?
Decide how and when you get contacted? And, only give your details
to the 1 company you decide to rent with.</p>

<h2 id="scenario-2">Scenario 2</h2>

<p>You’re looking for a new job. You sign up to 10 different
recruitment websites, and job portals. 
You get a regular stream of newsletters, several per
day from different sources. </p>

<p>Once you’ve found a job you have to remember everywhere you
signed up and go around unsubscribing from each of the 
emails. Or you don’t and they keep filling your inbox.</p>

<p>What if you could unsubscribe from all of them at the same time, 
in one simple operation?</p>

<h2 id="scenario-3">Scenario 3</h2>

<p>You’re planning a holiday or a trip somewhere. You use the 
web to do research. This involves filling in lots of 
contact forms around the web while you make enquiries about
places to visit, things to do, and places to stay. </p>

<p>You’re never sure who you’re giving your personal details
to. Are companies going to keep marketing to you? 
Will they sell your details on as a qualified “lead” to other 
companies?</p>

<p>What if you could make an enquiry online and only share 
your personal details once you’re more comfortable with who
you’re doing business with?</p>

<h2 id="current-solutions">Current solutions</h2>

<p>How many sites have you signed up to in the past?
If you use a login manager or password manager, then at least you 
might have some idea of where you’ve given away your details, and 
what websites you’re registered with. </p>

<p>Maybe you’ve resorted to using a fake email address, or
a temporary email account? This only solves part of the 
problem, because if you’re expecting a reply you have to check
a separate email account. Also, many contact forms and email
services try to reject temporary email accounts because
they are often a source of spam or abuse. </p>

<h2 id="identity-proxy">Identity Proxy</h2>

<p>What if we take a different approach, and instead of a “fake”
temporary identity, we use a “verified” temporary identity?
The company can see you’re a real verified person, but 
you stay in control of what information you want to give 
away. </p>

<p>We also group enquiries and registrations into projects. 
This means that once you’ve found your apartment, finished
your job hunt, or returned from holiday, you can 
close your temporary identity, and shut off contact from
all the companies you sent enquiries to, or registered with.
Apart from the companies you want to continue to do business
with, who have been given your real contact details. </p>

<p>This is why we think of it as escrow for your contact details.</p>

<p>Also, by grouping enquiries into projects and sending them
via the proxy, you can also decide how, and when, you want
to receive replies. This makes the communication easier to
manage, plus they can be combined into a standard
format to make it easy to compare. </p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-companies">What about the companies?</h2>

<p>Companies that are good internet citizens, and don’t hassle
customers, and abide by best practises should welcome this idea.
It’s better than receiving a fake temporary email address, because they
are assured by the verification that it is a real enquiry.</p>

<p>We plan to support the <a href="http://www.list-unsubscribe.com/">list unsubscribe header</a>.
If you’re running a mailing list or registration system, 
you should already be implementing this on every message you send.
We are building support for this standard into our system to help companies 
keep their lists clean.</p>

<h2 id="that-all-sounds-very-complicated"> That all sounds very complicated</h2>

<p>Well, behind the scenes there’s a lot we’re doing to make it 
work seamlessly. But, it should be no more difficult than
sending an email, or filling in a contact form on a website.</p>

<p>There’s no extra work involved for the person making the 
enquiries, and it will save them lots of time being able
to “unsubscribe” to a whole project group in one go.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>We’re going to continue development. We’ve started a 
website at <a href="http://idproxy.co">idproxy.co</a> where you can 
register to be notified when we launch the service. </p>

<p>Any questions, feedback, thoughts, please get in touch.</p>

<p>Is this a service you would use? </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
