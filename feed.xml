        <title>TinyLetter #5 - Cyril, Fractals, and a Book</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is the first time you’ve received my TinyLetter, welcome!
Since the last letter, a couple of people joined (via my website)
and I added everyone from my LinkedIn account. 
Apologies if you don’t want this. Let me know and I’ll remove you,
or use the unsubscribe link. No hard feelings. 
If you’re unsure what this is, check the letter archive on my
website. I don’t use Facebook, so this is my way of
spamming everyone I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in the last letter that my contact at MTV was
coming to an end. That’s done now, and I’m looking for new
opportunities. I’ve been keeping myself busy for the past couple of months. 
I’ve given a couple of training courses.
One about Drupal 7, although with Drupal 8 adoption rising, I’m
hoping that will be the last time I’m asked to do a D7 training.
I’ve also been doing general PHP trainings, which I’ve written up into a book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/phpframework&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/letter5-book-sm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PHP Book&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a short guide, intended to be a weekend project, based on teaching modern PHP to Drupal developers. It was originally intended to help developers move from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8. 
I refined the content, rewrote it a few times, and it’s now a basic
 introduction to modern PHP aimed at all web developers.
It’s available from &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/phpframework&quot;&gt;Leanpub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/letter5-cyril-resonate-sm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cyril at Resonate&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been dedicating some time to the development of Cyril.
There’s been a mini spurt of interest in my live-coding language
since the Resonate festival in Serbia. Cyril user Dan Hett gave a 
lecture, and I had chance to demo it to a few new people. 
Dan gave a great talk about his work, about live-coding in general, 
and did a live demo of Cyril up on the big screen in the main hall.
In response to feedback, I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/cyril-live-coding/getting-started-with-beta-6-c74e93463c3d&quot;&gt;getting started guide&lt;/a&gt;, 
and I have been working on a cross-platform build to get it
working on Windows and Linux (yes, it’s OSX only at the moment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a new website for Cyril, and I posted an article
&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/cyril-live-coding/cyril-the-story-so-far-b77a7f90d37f&quot;&gt;“Cyril, The Story So Far…”&lt;/a&gt; that explains how I got from mind-reading octopus, to
live-coding language for visuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resonate was awesome this year. I learned a lot, and found lots of inspiration. I’ve already 
bought my ticket for next year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/06/05/more-3d-fractals/&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/letter5-fractal-sm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fractal #13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve posted up some of my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/06/05/more-3d-fractals/&quot;&gt;fractal art&lt;/a&gt;. 
This image above is my
personal favourite out of all the “discoveries” I’ve made so far.
I’ve posted up more creations on my 
website &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2016/06/05/more-3d-fractals/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, including a couple of failed experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I’m not going to be at Glastonbury this year, but
I did find this interesting 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Hampstead-Heath-Philosophy-Walks/events/231660330/&quot;&gt;Philosophy walk&lt;/a&gt; 
around Hampstead Heath, so I think I’ll be doing that 
next weekend instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, and do let me know what you’re up to,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daz&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PHP Framework in One Weekend</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I set about creating a day of training for 
DrupalCamp London. It was based on a PHP Framework
course I’d given, but reduced to fit into a day. 
We ended up focusing on Modern PHP, as that was most useful for the
attendees in their transition from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a really successful day, and I had some great feedback. 
I have since developed the idea into a two day training course,
which looks at some of the core concepts behind most modern PHP apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of months I have worked hard to refine the 
content and edit it down into a short guide. I’ve released it
(thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/phpframework&quot;&gt;Leanpub&lt;/a&gt;)
in the form of a book. It guides the reader through a 
weekend-long project to construct a simple PHP web framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“a weekend, the fundamental unit of coding self-improvement” 
- Peter Shirley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, it uses Symfony Components, and some other popular
PHP packages, to demonstrate the core features of
web frameworks, like routing, templating, controllers, and 
dependency injection. Projects such as Drupal, phpBB, Laravel, eZ Publish, Joomla!, Magento, Piwik, and many more are using Symfony Components as a foundation on which to build. The book uses these, and more, to build our own PHP Framework
in a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the full contents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting Started&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managing Complexity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HTTP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Templating&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Routing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Controllers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dependency Injection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design and Layout&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reuse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the cover image below to get the book:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3D Fractals</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Click images below to get the large, high-quality versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of my most recent creations…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/13.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/13sm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created that image above with a program called Mandelbulb 3D. 
It includes many fractal equations, including the 3D version of the
famous Mandelbrot set, the Mandelbulb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it hard at first to get anything interesting out of 
Mandelbulb, so I went off on an exploration of fractal geometry.
I figured I’d be able to get better results if I knew the theory
behind what the equations were doing, rather than just randomly 
combining fractal equations and randomly tweaking parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with the Mandelbrot set, like most 
people who start experimenting with fractals. I quickly moved on to some simple iterated functions. My very first experiments were with some equations I found in 
an old book “Symmetry in Chaos” by Michael Field and Martin Golubitsky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/05.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/05tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/06.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/06tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I combined this method of plotting the images, with 
fractal equations, and it mainly went wrong. 
Some of the wrong images actually looked quite interesting…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/09.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/09tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I accidentally came up with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/08.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/08sm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was actually a black and white render, but I’ve applied some fake colouring. 
I thought it looked a bit “spacey”, so I sampled colours from a 
universe photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to Mandelbulb, my search for interesting fractal combinations
was much more fruitful. Some of my discoveries are below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, I was using fog to emphasise depth. In some
cases I think I overdid it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/01.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/01tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the most “realistic” images have come from
using colours sampled from real photos. The hardest part
of creating this next image was getting the camera angle right. 
I think the sampled colours make it look almost like a real
forest scene. Natural colours (sampled from real photos) tend to be much more 
desaturated than the colours picked manually…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/02.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/02tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first experiment with combining two fractal formulas. 
Rather than alternating multiple formulas to create a combined 
geometry, you can visualise the output of two formulas, if you can align 
them correctly…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/03.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/03tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one has a grainy look because I reduced the quality to 
speed up the rendering process. 
I thought it looked a bit like a jellyfish, so I added some 
colours to make it look like it was underwater. 
Unfortunately, when I increased the quality to create the 
final render it lost it’s form. So, here’s the grainy version…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/07.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/07tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This next one might be my favourite so far. 
Click to see full version. I really like the 
shading on the “moon” in the background…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/10.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/10tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a few more of my fractal experiments…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/04.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/04tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/11.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/11tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/12.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/12tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/14.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/14tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/15.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/15tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/16.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/16tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/17.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/17tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/18.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/18tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fractals/19.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fractals/19tm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>TinyLetter #4 - Tiny McLetterface</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was March 2016!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will always remember it as the month in which the British public voted to name a £200 million polar research vessel “Boaty McBoatface.” A clear winner, the name received over 90,000 more votes than the second closest rival name. I hope the Natural Environment Research Council follow through and name the ship after the public vote. Then we’ll have at least one positive outcome from voting in the UK this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke at a conference earlier in the month. I tried something a bit different this time. Instead of a technical talk, I gave a more philosophical talk about changes in Drupal and the web. As a thought experiment, I went back in time to the mid 90s, and tried to explain to myself what we had done. Speaking to a room of web developers, I suggested that we have encouraged centralisation by ruining the experience on the open web. I presented some ideas to stop ruining the web, and some ideas to make it better. I think it went well, and I had some great feedback. The rest of the conference I spent catching up with people, and discussing ideas for new models of collaboration. I’ve been writing up my notes, and I’ll post them to my blog at some point soon. I hope to try out some of the ideas on future projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month I attended London’s first Consciousness Hacking meetup. The highlight was Robert Thomas who uses biometric feedback to generate personalised music experiences. This took me back to my experiments with neurofeedback, when I hacked a MindFlex toy to make a basic EEG reader. These experiments lead to me inventing the Cyril programming language. This meetup got me excited about getting back into this. And, I’ve now got a new EEG headset to experiment with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event gave a different perspective on how technology might serve us. One of the presenters, Patrick Hilsbos, said “the world would be a better place if technology served as a catalyst for self-awareness, self-love, and true connection.” He is working on creating a “Spotify for experiences” using biofeedback for meditation, focus training, and relaxation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My contract at MTV is coming to an end this month. Once I’ve finished, I’ll be looking for other projects. I’ve got a few requests for training, but other than that, in the short term I’ll be going back to my own projects. In particular, Cyril, the programming language I invented for live coding visuals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be returning to Serbia again next month, for Resonate. The conference which “brings together artists and educators to drive a forward-looking debate on the position of technology in art and culture.” It was one of my highlights of last year. Even more excited about it this year, because among the 44 lectures, will be one by Dan Hett. Dan makes use of my Cyril live coding language, and has contributed ideas (and code for Post Processing effects). I’m looking forward to seeing what Dan’s been up to. I hope it will be a chance for us to talk about the roadmap for future development of Cyril. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a great month, and drop me a line let me know what you’re up to, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daz  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unwired</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a bold move, Wired have removed themselves from the open web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/wired-blocked.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy buying the printed version of Wired magazine. Packed full of glossy adverts, I assumed this supported the online version. It seems that is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand why Wired are doing this. With a more tech savvy audience, I guess they are suffering more from the rise of adblocking than others. Reports have claimed publishers earn less from advertising than users pay in bandwidth charges. Using an adblocker is now a necessity. It saves money, and improves the experience and performance of the open web. I’m sure Wired have taken this all into account. It is clear we need new a new model, and it’s brave of Wired to push this on us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open web is the platform we are all building together. Our competition are the walled-garden silos. We are building a free and open ecosystem. Our competition are the closed monoliths with a single gatekeeper. The variety of experience across the open web can be our strength, but also our weakness. Our competition has tight control over user experience and strives to remove all friction. They may disrespect and exploit users in many ways, but they do respect user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this doesn’t just remove Wired from the open web. This is a blow to everyone building the open web. It degrades the experience for our users. It contributes to the ruining of the open web, pushing users to centralised silos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hit this barrier when following a link to an article on Wired from the open web. Wired refused access. Unexpected blockages like this create a bad experience for our (the open web’s) users. By degrading the experience on the open web we push people to centralised silos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are we going to deal with this on the open web? Do we need some way to mark up links that lead away from the open web?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we make it clear when links go off to centralised silos? Can we markup links to paywalls, adblock-blockers, or with otherwise unexpected behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we (the open web) innovate a way to remunerate publishers? Can we do this without blocking, creating friction, or otherwise ruining user experience?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Semantic Drift</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Language is always evolving. Words go out of common usage, new words appear, and words change their meaning. The firehose of social media has given us new words, like the “selfie” and “clickbait”. The narcissistic undercurrent in these new terms indicates how these technologies are changing us. But, more concerning, are words where the actual meaning is changing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Orwell coined the term &lt;em&gt;doublethink&lt;/em&gt; in the novel 1984. It formed part of Big Brother’s brainwashing programmes in which words take on dual meanings, leading to acceptance of conflict or contradiction via language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talk about &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt; media, but a more appropriate term would be &lt;em&gt;anti-social&lt;/em&gt; media. When you hear phrases like “my selfie has 50 likes”, it’s less about being social, and more about bragging. A “social stream” feeds trivialities to followers, fans and friends. The danger is that this shallow form of connection, via the screen, mediated by technology, is replacing real meaningful connection and companionship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the concept of &lt;em&gt;friend&lt;/em&gt;. As I mentioned in my post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2015/12/03/work-in-progress/&quot;&gt;why I left Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, “you can have 1000 friends on Facebook, but only if you reduce your definition of what it means to be a friend.” We also now have &lt;em&gt;unfriend&lt;/em&gt; as a verb. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other nouns are becoming verbs, like &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt;. I hear people saying “inbox me”, or “I’ll inbox you”, when they referring to sending a private message. This annoys me. It may seem innocuous, but it highlights a lack of understanding about the difference between a message and where the message is stored. We have, in one word, conflated the process of sending a message with both it’s place of storage and the act of receiving it. When you consider the temporal aspects of this, it reveals the acceptance of omnipresent access to our attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most abused word is &lt;em&gt;share&lt;/em&gt;. We have lost touch completely with what it really means to share something. From the compulsive &lt;em&gt;sharing&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;selfies&lt;/em&gt; driven by a need for acceptance and dopamine reward, to the rebranding of “unsolicited advertising” as “sharing” on social media. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also hear a lot of the word &lt;em&gt;share&lt;/em&gt; with the rise of the (so called) &lt;em&gt;sharing&lt;/em&gt; economy. Uber and AirBnB are not based on sharing at all. It’s not sharing if you are paying a fee. And, the focus of startups in the “sharing economy” isn’t on creating a cooperative (shared) platform. They are actually about crowd-sourcing a monopoly. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AMA: What search engine(s) do you favour? I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re not a Google fan!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Good question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search engine is the filter through which we access the vast information available on the web. This is a powerful position to be in, considering the influence that the web has on our lives. I would love to pay for a premium search service that operates on my behalf. But, unfortunately, that is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead we have chosen dependency on free services run by huge corporations that make billions of dollars by manipulating what we see online. We license them free access to our valuable data. They build a rich profile of us from data about every aspect of our lives. They own our phone, email, documents, search history, DNS lookups, and web browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would suggest not using the same company for search as you use for email or other personal information. Unfortunately, no search engine has the power of Google to produce such good results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use DuckDuckGo as my default search engine. I like to use an alternative as my first attempt to find what I’m looking for. I then revert to Google as a second resort. 80% of the time the results don’t match what I’m expecting to see. In which case I prepend ‘!g ‘ to the search term in DuckDuckGo. This redirects to Google search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow this also avoids the privacy pop-up I see when I go straight to Google:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/google-popup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Google Privacy Popup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching Google via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/bang&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo Bang&lt;/a&gt; leads me straight to the results. I don’t know what happens to the annoying pop-up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Build Your Own PHP Framework at DrupalCamp London</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have revised and improved the training in preparation for DrupalCamp next week. I’ve incorporated some feedback, added a bit of theory, and included more practical examples. Join me and level up your PHP development skills in this 1 day course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build Your Own PHP Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn modern PHP practices and see the benefits first hand via practical examples. Learn object oriented design and how to apply design patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of old PHP code and information around on the web. With the massive improvements in PHP in recent years, a lot of this information is wrong and out of date. In this course I will be focusing on only modern, state of the art PHP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 means adopting modern, object-oriented, PHP practices. Drupal 8 has gone through a process of “getting off the island” and embracing the wider PHP ecosystem. We, as PHP developers using Drupal, can improve our own processes by doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building your own framework is a great way to learn the fundamentals of modern PHP. Regardless of your choice of framework, this will make you a better developer. A similar foundation of components underlies Drupal, Symfony, Silex, and Lavavel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn framework decoupling techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write better code by avoiding unnecessary complexity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use Domain Driven Design to tackle complexity and design better solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go beyond MVC and start to explore other design patterns such as command bus and repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn simple strategies you can immediately apply to develop better code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand the components at the core of Drupal 8, many other PHP frameworks and popular PHP apps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Digestible 40 minute sections interspersed with practical workshop where you get hands-on experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need a basic knowledge of PHP and a laptop that can run PHP. You will leave with a better understanding of the principles behind modern PHP and Drupal 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tickets-available-herehttpseventsr20constantcontactcomregistereventregoeidka07ebt79sow1ef68caboseqcch&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/eventReg?oeidk=a07ebt79sow1ef68cab&amp;amp;oseq=&amp;amp;c=&amp;amp;ch=&quot;&gt;Tickets available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;£295.00 or
£95.00 concession tickets for sole traders, students and charities.
The training will be on Friday March 4, 2016 at City University London.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TinyLetter #3 - is the Magic Number</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Posting up my third TinyLetter for posterity.
See my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/contact/&quot;&gt;contact page&lt;/a&gt; for details of how to join my “Friends and Family” email list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to say that I’m writing this from the comfort of our new home. Nikki and I found a lovely little flat, just a few minutes walk from Queens Park in North West London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week overlap before Nikki’s tenancy is up has given me a chance to have a clear out. I finally got all my stuff out of storage, after 6 months, and immediately set about purging. And it feels great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I had a clear out like this was several years ago, before my sojourn in Sardegna. Since returning to London I’ve collected quite a lot of crap. I recently read “&lt;a href=&quot;http://http//tidyingup.com/books/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-hc&quot;&gt;The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up&lt;/a&gt;” by Marie Kondo. This gave me a different perspective on the process of tidying, and I hope this leads to lasting change. I’m certainly experiencing a clarity, and lightness, that tidying hasn’t given me before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a weekend in Brussels for FOSDEM, the annual Free and Open Source Developers Meeting. I joined over 5,000 developers to talk about open source and software freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was obvious, while enroute to the opening session, how different this event was going to be. If it wasn’t for the swarm of developers, or the delivery of a truck-load of Club Mate, you could have missed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first FOSDEM. I’ve never been to a conference quite like this. There was no registration required to attend and the sponsorship was subtle. Unlike other tech conferences I’ve attended in recent years. Usually I’d expect excessive corporate branding, and sales pitches disguised as sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sense, FOSDEM is the antithesis of the New Relic DevOps summit I attended last week. I had to leave this “summit” after just a couple of hours because it had been all sales pitch and no content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM packed in over 310 hours of scheduled content into the weekend. Various communities come together here united by common values of openness and freedom. Values that pervade through every aspect of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main takeaway from the weekend was a deeper understanding of the distinction between open source and free software. I’ve been struggling to reconcile my drive to be independent, and to go serverless. I didn’t reach any conclusions this weekend. I didn’t resolve anything, but hearing from others gave me some new perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my return to London I attended Dialogue. I’ve become a regular attendee of these events, on the first Wednesday of the month. The event is “a creative dialogue between science, art, technology, ethics and politics.” Every month I leave frustrated, yet keep going back for more. This month was a subject close to my heart. The conversation was “Privacy, Protection, Publicity: Does Your Freedom Have Boundaries?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, there was an incredible panel of experts from various fields. But, as usual, the conversation didn’t go deep enough into any aspect of the topic. Instead, the discussion flits between reasoned insights and misinformed throwaway comments. Despite this the event is very entertaining and informative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current series has come to an end, and they’ve not annouced the next batch yet. I’ll keep an eye out, as it’s a worthwhile way to spend a Wednesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continue to rethink my relationship with technology. This month I [wrote about my decision to leave WhatsApp](http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2016/01/27/why-i-left-whatsapp/. I also summerised my ongoing dithering over &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2016/02/02/rethinking-twitter/&quot;&gt;what to do about Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming up in the next month…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DrupalCamp London accepted my session proposal. I’ll be talking about “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2016/01/21/survive-and-thrive-drupal-8/&quot;&gt;surviving - and thriving - during the transition to Drupal 8&lt;/a&gt;”. This talk builds on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2015/11/16/surviving-open-source-gentrification/&quot;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt; where I used gentrification as a metaphore for changes in the Drupal community. I bring in some new research and experiences, and draw some interesting conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also be running a training day on the Friday. It will be the third year I’ve run training at the Camp. This time I’m doing something different. I’ve created a course called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2016/02/11/drupal-camp-london-training/&quot;&gt;Build your own PHP Framework&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conciousness Hacking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be attending this “&lt;a href=&quot;http://http//www.meetup.com/Consciousness-Hacking-London/events/228318878/&quot;&gt;Consciousness Hacking&lt;/a&gt;” meetup next month. I’m not sure what to expect, but the event intrigues me. It’s described as “a growing global community encouraging exploration into the ways that technology can be in service to the highest ideals of humanity and support the evolution of our individual and collective experience.” Sounds right up my street!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a great month! Drop me a line and let me know what you’re up to,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daz&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Playing with Infinity in PHP</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been playing around with lazy evaluation in PHP.
This is made possible by using Generators, added to PHP 5.5
and refined in PHP 7.
You can do some cool stuff with infinite (or very
large) data sets, and avoid getting stuck in infinite loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to create an infinitely long array of the same value.
Here’s a simple bit of code that would do this. Obviously don’t try this.
Just read the code and imagine a world where this is a good idea…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;function repeat($i)
{
    $output = [];
    while (true)
    {
        $output[] = $i;
    }
    return $output;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This function would never terminate. You get stuck in an
infinite loop. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;while(true)&lt;/code&gt; is not something you ever want to see
in a program, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not if you do lazy evaluation. In this context lazy means you
only evaluate as much code as you need to get the result. So you
can have large, even infinite, sets of data, without getting stuck in
long, or infinite, loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHP has a feature for lazy evaluation. It’s called a Generator,
summoned into being using the magical &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; keyword.
Here’s the stupid repeat, but this time as a generator…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;function repeat($i)
{
    while (true)
    {
        yield $i;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to be careful using infinite sets.
You can still easily create an unterminating program if you tried to print
out the whole of this Generator function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, what if we just wanted to work with the first 5 items from
our infinite computation. This is now possible because of lazy
evaulation. Here’s a take function that will take
any number of items from any Generator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;function take($i, Generator $generator)
{
    while ($i-- &amp;gt; 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $generator-&amp;gt;valid())
    {
        yield $generator-&amp;gt;current();
        $generator-&amp;gt;next();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take 5…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;foreach (take(5, repeat(&#39;Hello&#39;)) as $item)
{
    echo $item, PHP_EOL;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, that was a stupid example. What about something a bit more
interesting? How about the classic fibonnacci sequence generator?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason the examples I found on both
&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19835499/recursive-generators-in-php&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;
and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://php.net/manual/en/language.generators.syntax.php&quot;&gt;PHP Manual&lt;/a&gt;
were more complex than they needed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the simplist infinite fibonacci generator I can think of…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;function fib()
{
    yield $i = 0;
    yield $j = 1;
    while (true) {
        yield $k = $i + $j;
        $i = $j;
        $j = $k;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s the first 50 fibonacci numbers…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;foreach (take(50, fib()) as $item)
{
    echo $item, PHP_EOL;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, here’s the first 10, skipping the first 0 using a tail function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;function tail(Generator $list)
{
    $list-&amp;gt;next();
    yield from $list;
}

foreach (take(50, tail(fib())) as $item)
{
    echo $item, PHP_EOL;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you’re curious, there are actual use cases for this.
For example, this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MarkBaker/GeneratorQuadTrees&quot;&gt;Quad Tree&lt;/a&gt;
data structure implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generators may not offer better performance in terms of execution speed.
But, generator based algorythms offer a much lower memory overhead
as you’re not having to pass around the full data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
