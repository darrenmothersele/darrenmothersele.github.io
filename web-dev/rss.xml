                                <title>Build Your Own PHP Framework</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m excited to announce that I&amp;#39;ll be back running training at this year&amp;#39;s Drupal Camp in London. This will be the 3rd year in a row that I&amp;#39;ve offered training at the camp. I&amp;#39;m doing something a bit different this time...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Build Your Own PHP Framework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this training you will build your own PHP framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, why reinvent the wheel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building your own framework is a great way to learn the fundamentals of modern PHP. Regardless of your choice of framework, this will make you a better developer. A similar foundation of components underlies Drupal, Symfony, Silex, and Lavavel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a developer going from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 then you need to adopt an object-oriented mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal doesn&amp;#39;t always get it right. If you understand the basic principles you know when and why you&amp;#39;re breaking them. You can make pragmatic choices as a programmer, without embodying bad practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Build Your Own Framework&amp;quot; is a fun training to learn modern PHP. You will learn the &amp;quot;SOLID&amp;quot; principles of PHP package design. The training will demystify dependency injection, hexagonal architecture and other design patterns. We will look at HTTP Foundation and the other Symfony components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come armed with a basic knowledge of PHP, a laptop that can run PHP, and an open mind. Leave with a better understanding of the principles behind modern PHP and Drupal 8.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>PHP Processing Pipeline</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re faced with refactoring a huge bunch of sequential code
then a pipeline may be the answer.
With a processing pipeline you create your code in stages.
Then you compose the stages into a pipeline, and pass your
input for processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great because each of the stages can be easily tested
independently. It also makes the code much easier to read and
maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a nice and simple implementation published by the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://thephpleague.com/&quot;&gt;League of Extraordinary Packages&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;#39;ve created a fork (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/darrenmothersele/pipeline&quot;&gt;on GitHub here&lt;/a&gt;)
which offers an even simpler syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a very basic example to show off this new syntax.
You create your stages as simple classes with an invoke method.
For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;class Double {
    public function __invoke($payload)
    {
        return $payload * 2;
    }
}

class Square {
    public function __invoke($payload)
    {
        return $payload * $payload;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could even pass in parameters to the stage constructor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;class Add {
    private $i;
    public function __construct($i)
    {
        $this-&amp;gt;i = $i;
    }
    public function __invoke($payload)
    {
        return $payload + $this-&amp;gt;i;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then create a &lt;code&gt;Pipeline&lt;/code&gt; to chain the stages together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$pipe = (new Pipeline)-&amp;gt;Double()-&amp;gt;Square()-&amp;gt;Add(10);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then you can process values using the Pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;echo $pipe-&amp;gt;process(10), PHP_EOL;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even process a list of values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;var_dump(array_map($pipe, [1, 2, 3]));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously you are not just limited to processing integers as in these
examples. XML documents, converting to JSON, filtering, translating
and other transformations are great candidates for pipelines stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve submitted a pull request for my simple modification. All I did
was add an implementation of the &lt;code&gt;__call()&lt;/code&gt; method so you can
add stages without having to explicitly &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;-up objects and
pass them into the &lt;code&gt;pipe()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully my pull request gets accepted. The only thing to be aware
of is that I made use of the variadic operator, so it needs a PHP
version of 5.6 or greater.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>The Future of (My) Web Part 3 - Rethinking Twitter</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel sorry for Twitter. It&amp;#39;s never been sure what it&amp;#39;s supposed to be. Twitter pioneered and popularised the idea of microblogging, then  almost killed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of my ongoing experiment I have stopped using
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2015/12/03/work-in-progress/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2016/01/27/why-i-left-whatsapp/&quot;&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;. The decision is not as simple this time as I don&amp;#39;t want to completely remove myself from Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#39;s wrong with Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined Twitter in April 2008 while at the first Social Innovation camp. The camp organisers used Twitter to broadcast messages to all attendees. It was useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter&amp;#39;s functionality was simple. It became a great example of how innovation can come from users. Features such as hash-tags emerged from how people used the technology. Compare this with other services that learnt how to limit and control their users by progressively introducing features. Such as Facebook&amp;#39;s slow boiling of the privacy frog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is another corporate controlled silo. And, compared to the lo-fi, elegant, and clean idea of 140 character public messaging, Twitter today is a mess. My stream flooded with image spam posted to draw attention to tweets. And, unnecessary screenshots of text posted to bypass the limited message size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How I Currently use Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To plan my future relationship with Twitter I have first looked at
how I currently use the service. I&amp;#39;ve identified the following types of usage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;0. Aggregator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a network of friends and colleagues in digital technology, creative coding, free software, and other interests. Twitter collects the thoughts, opinions, and silliness from this eclectic mix of people. This makes it fun and serious, informative and weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t find this variety of updates if they were not all aggregated into once place. But, at the same time, this can be a distracting waste of time. And it&amp;#39;s getting harder to filter out the signal from the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Live-blogging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m at an event with Wifi signal I tend to tweet a lot more than usual. I &lt;em&gt;live-blog&lt;/em&gt; my experience of the event, mainly for my own benefit. This makes it easier to remember what I did when I review the event afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. RSS feed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, people would subscribe to my RSS feed to get updated when I added new content to my site. Since Google killed RSS when they shut down Reader, nobody seems to do that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Twitter to post up bits from my own blog and writing, with links back to my site. Using it as a way to let people know I&amp;#39;ve posted something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Web Links&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also post up quotes and links to things I&amp;#39;ve found on the net. Useful stuff I&amp;#39;ve found for work, quotes for inspiration, or things related to my interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Observations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel the need to comment on things I observe. I particularly enjoy paradox and inconsistency. If I have my phone on me, and I&amp;#39;m in the right mood, I share on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Conversation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a noisy place to try and have a conversation with people. I love how anyone can chime in and join a conversation. I always enjoy hearing from other points of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I start public conversations with companies that have disappointed me. It&amp;#39;s a way to get a response, when they don&amp;#39;t answer the phone or emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Brain-dump&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I just post up random thoughts I&amp;#39;ve been having. Maybe these are things I don&amp;#39;t need to shout out to the world. But stuff I still want to log somewhere. Twitter isn&amp;#39;t the correct place for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Alternative to Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still want to engage with my network on Twitter. But I want to decouple my communication from the silo. This is what the Indie Web refer to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE&quot;&gt;POSSE&lt;/a&gt; (Post on Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking of what I&amp;#39;d like to build as an alternative to Twitter.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2015/07/12/happy-birthday-bucky/&quot;&gt;Buckminster Fuller&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s Dymaxion Chronofile comes to mind. Bucky documented his entire life, from the point where he started to live his life as an experiment, in what he called a &amp;quot;Chronofile&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have already implemented a private &amp;quot;idea log&amp;quot;. This is somewhere to post all the random thoughts that are not yet fully formed. This helps me collect disparate thoughts and allow them to coalesce
into something more considered. It creates space in my mind by getting things out of my head. Working like a real extension to my memory, some things stick around. But, also like real memory, I need a way to forget. Sometimes, it&amp;#39;s good to let go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posting notes to my own site, and syndicating them to Twitter, is now top of my list. This will be the next feature to develop for my website.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>My First Front-end London</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night I got to attend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frontendlondon.co.uk/&quot;&gt;FEL&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. The popular meetup, hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://madebymany.com/&quot;&gt;Made by Many&lt;/a&gt;, celebrating it&amp;#39;s 3rd anniversary last night. I have
&lt;a href=&quot;https://calumryan.com/&quot;&gt;Calum Ryan&lt;/a&gt;, fellow Indiewebber, to thank for sorting me out a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calum was up first talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://indiewebcamp.com/&quot;&gt;#indieweb&lt;/a&gt;. He summarised the movement well. The talk gave detail of the motivations, principles, and technology. I was happy to learn that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-webmention-20160112/&quot;&gt;Webmention has a first draft of a W3C standard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was encouraging to hear this was Calum&amp;#39;s first presentation. A great start, and I hope he continues on this path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;a href=&quot;http://bodil.lol/&quot;&gt;Bodil Stokke&lt;/a&gt; took us on a tour of generators in ES6. This makes me want to do more Javascript. If only because I have a thing for the world &lt;em&gt;yield&lt;/em&gt;. It might be my favourite word. I love all that it implies. For me, in conjures up images of Taoism, effortless action, and the path of least resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest was the backwards use of generators as consumers used in monads. We saw generators combined with Promises to write asynchronous code without callbacks. Simply beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation is &lt;a href=&quot;http://bodil.lol/generators/&quot;&gt;online here&lt;/a&gt;.
I also made a note to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/tj/co&quot;&gt;Co library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrapping up the trio of speakers for the night was &lt;a href=&quot;http://macr.ae/&quot;&gt;Callum Macrae&lt;/a&gt;.
With more Ls and more LOLs that the first Calum.
He took us on a humorous tour of ES6, under the guise of deprecating jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw how to replace jQuery features with native Javascript. With a polyfil, or transpiling, it seems jQuery does not add anything. Native Javascript winning on features in some cases. Callum also added that the overhead of using Babel is less than including jQuery. So there is no need for jQuery. Unless you want &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/rwaldron/8720084#file-reasons-md&quot;&gt;old browser compatibility&lt;/a&gt; or are using a library with a dependency on jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An entertaining and informative night. I&amp;#39;ll definitely be back.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Drupal Predictions for 2016</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;This will be a momentus year for Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David H, Drupal.org webmaster, was
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FromWayDowntown/status/692375858175148032&quot;&gt;soliciting responses&lt;/a&gt;
to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/node/2652402&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.
I kept my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/node/2652402#comment-10792382&quot;&gt;predictions&lt;/a&gt;
brief, but thought I would post here to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people may be predicting &lt;a href=&quot;https://securityintelligence.com/news/new-year-new-problems-cms-vulnerabilites-take-on-2016/&quot;&gt;a year of security vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;. I believe we have a
year of innovation ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal&amp;#39;s ecosystem of contributed modules is playing catch-up since the
release of version 8. It has been years since CCK and Views were just
experiments in the contrib module space.
They are now established as foundation of Drupal core.
Contrib (the wider community of Drupal developers) can now get back to innovating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get back to innovating&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t much of a prediction. I thought about it
some more and came up with three things I think are likely to happen in 2016...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CMS-as-a-Service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The era of the monolythic, does-it-all, CMS is coming to an end.
The Drupal community talk a lot about &lt;em&gt;progressive decoupling&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://buytaert.net/should-we-decouple-drupal-with-a-client-side-framework&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://buytaert.net/selecting-a-client-side-framework-for-drupal&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;.
But, the idea of a &lt;em&gt;fully decoupled&lt;/em&gt; backend is becoming established
in other areas. Services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.contentful.com/&quot;&gt;Contentful&lt;/a&gt; already
provide a fully decoupled, headless CMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems become decoupled, we move to a microservice architecture, and evaluate server-less options. It is conceivable that a Content API could become part of the infrastructure. Amazon are the leading Infrastructure-as-a-Service provider. A Content API (or CMS-as-a-Service) would fit in their suite of cloud computing services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did an experiment recently where I put Amazon&amp;#39;s API Gateway in front of an EC2 instance running Drupal. This gives a more robust API on top of Drupal 8&amp;#39;s Rest support. Monitoring, traffic management, and flexible security controls are standard.
This approach offers several advantages, including: &lt;a href=&quot;http://swagger.io/&quot;&gt;Swagger&lt;/a&gt; support;
CloudFront caching for performance; and input/output
translation with data models defined with JSON schema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Acquia IPO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going public was always on the cards for Acquia, but they said they
&lt;a href=&quot;http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2015/10/21/acquia-engage-ceo-talks-content-hub-valuation-ipo/&quot;&gt;are in no rush to IPO&lt;/a&gt;. This could be the year. Adoption of D8 will being changes
to the user base and continued adoption at the enterprise level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be accompanied by more consolidation in the Drupal world.
One of the biggest risks I see is with Drupal companies taking on
bigger projects. A single client becomes a large contributer to their
revenue, in some cases I&amp;#39;ve heard as much as 70%. This is a risky situation
to be in, if you rely on one client for a majority of your business.
The solution is for Drupal companies to come together to form larger entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a continuation of an existing trend.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wunderkraut.com/blog/worlds-largest-drupal-provider-created-by-merger/2012-08-20&quot;&gt;Wunderkraut&lt;/a&gt;,
was the most high-profile merger in the community.
Followed by many more, involving companies such as
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wearepropeople.com/news/propeople-and-blink-reaction-come-together-to-form-ffw-a-new-global-digital-agency&quot;&gt;FFW&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mediacurrent.com/blog/mediacurrent-acquired-by-code-and-theory&quot;&gt;MediaCurrent&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phase2technology.com/blog/phase2-and-opensourcery-whats-new-in-portland/&quot;&gt;Phase2&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i-kos.com/press-release/2014-09-22/mogdesign-joins-ikos-digital-accelerate-drupal-growth&quot;&gt;i-Kos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Composer Support and Decoupled Components&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Composer support in Drupal needs some work.
There are some big wins to be had by embracing the
Composer (and Packagist) workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commerce Guys are leading the way with Drupal Commerce. They have been
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/commerceguys&quot;&gt;factoring out components into separate libraries&lt;/a&gt;.
Other PHP projects beyond Drupal are making use of them, and contributing to
their development.
Expect more contrib projects to factor out separate PHP packages of re-usable code.
Then Drupal modules become just a thin layer of glue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a trend for PHP Frameworks to decouple their core components.
The Symfony Components split from the full stack framework has
meant much wider adoption. They are used in &lt;a href=&quot;http://symfony.com/projects&quot;&gt;many PHP projects&lt;/a&gt;,
including Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHP-FIG exists to promote interoperability between frameworks. This year will see further initiatives to clean up Drupal&amp;#39;s code. Such as, removal of anti-patterns like service locator. The eventual aim will be to decoupling components from Drupal core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine using Views on a non-drupal project?&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Work in Progress: The Future of (My) Web (Part 2, Leaving WhatsApp)</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve deleted WhatsApp. I wasn&amp;#39;t going to post about this,
as I don&amp;#39;t want to sound like a broken record.
But, as several people have emailed me asking why,
I thought I would explain my decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2015/12/03/work-in-progress/&quot;&gt;posted about this before&lt;/a&gt;
when I left Facebook.
I&amp;#39;m not just ranting about data surveillance and privacy concerns.
I have other concerns about our relationship with technology. There are
certain ideas that are in danger of becoming locked in unless
we come up with alternatives.
My attitude is solution focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So WhatsWrong with WhatsApp?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It&amp;#39;s free.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They annouced recently that they are removing the subscription and making the service free.
There is now no doubt what the real business model is.
You are not their customer, you are their product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;No API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Acton, WhatsApp cofounder, has publicly stated that there will never be an API.
Interoperability is never going to be an option with Whatsapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare with email: You use gmail, someone else uses hotmail, and I have my own email
software I built myself. We can all freely email each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re on different mobile networks, but we can still freely send each other SMS messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will never be the case with WhatsApp.
If you&amp;#39;re not on WhatsApp you don&amp;#39;t exist.
WhatsApp is a monoculture silo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be part of building an independent, open future.
The involves removing myself from networks that don&amp;#39;t support open standards, interoperability, and diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the principle of &amp;quot;selfdogfooding&amp;quot;, removing myself gives me the motiviation
I need to build and contribute to an alternative
&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiewebcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Indie Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the ‘corporate web’.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                                <title>Session submission guidelines for conferences and camps</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week I found out that the date for my nephew&amp;#39;s christening has changed. This means I can now make it to the Drupal Camp in London. I decided to propose a session so that I can share my recent insights, research, and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Drupal Camp London team have kept the session submission process minimal. This makes it easy for people to submit proposals, but it makes it unclear what the expectations are. What are they looking for in proposed sessions? How long are the sessions expected to be? What is the review process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I only found out I could attend at the last minute, I had no time to enquire about the process. So I made some assumptions based on my experiences of programming at previous camps. I also did some research into other Drupal camp and conference session submission processes.
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/news/session-selection-drupalcon-inside-out.html&quot;&gt;Amsterdam Drupalcon site&lt;/a&gt; had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There’s a lot of elements to session selection. We need to make sure that sessions are of value to a wide audience. The presenters must be engaging speakers who can interest a large crowd of attendees. We try as hard as we can to bring in new (to DrupalCon) speakers, and speakers who bring something from outside of the Drupal sphere. We want to make sure that the diversity of the community is represented and encouraged. And we need to work across track teams to ensure that one speaker is not speaking in several tracks; both for the sake of their stress and sanity in preparing the talks and to ensure that everyone who applied has the best chance of speaking. Finally, we need to make sure that sessions fit both the theme of the track and of the conference.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.drupal.org/barcelona2015/session-submission-live&quot;&gt;Barcelona Drupalcon&lt;/a&gt; offered the following 3 part session submission formula...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 1: Describe a compelling topic that affects the reader directly, maybe a pain point, or juicy new technology. &lt;br&gt;
Part 2: Allude to your solution, sharing just enough that the reader has a moment of &amp;quot;I need that ...how do I not know this already?&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;
Part 3: Explain how awesome the session will be because you are going to cover &amp;quot;XYZ&amp;quot; and make the reader&amp;#39;s life so much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My session selection criteria&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realised that I&amp;#39;ve done session selection myself many times. At every conference, camp, and symposium I attend I make my own selection of sessions to attend. The key to making the most out of attending a conference is to attend the right sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Resonate last year I set the intention of broadening my horizons, so intentionally selected session that I would not normally be exposed to. And sessions that offered something new. At DrupalCon in Amsterdam I set the intension of getting as deep into Drupal 8 as possible. So I attended every D8 session I could. Selecting the sessions I thought offered the most opportunity for learning. It helps if they are recognisable names, or people I&amp;#39;ve seen present before and know they do a good session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I think about my own criteria, I get it down to five things...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Importance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this definitely a session worth attending? Is the session topic cutting edge, or immediately relevant to my situation. Is it ground breaking or offer a significant contribution to the field?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this the right type of session? Is the purpose of the session clear? Does the description make it clear what the expected participant outcomes are? Does the description give enough specific information to make me want to know more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the session motivated by theory, practice, and/or research? Is this presented in a detailed, thorough, and comprehensible way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Substantiated&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are all claims (practices, conclusions, proposals) well substantiated. Is the speaker presenting something they know about? Is the speaker well positioned to be giving the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Clarity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the session proposal clear? A well written session description indicates the presentation itself will be of professional quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I managed to purvey these five points in my own
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2016/01/21/survive-and-thrive-drupal-8/&quot;&gt;session proposal&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;d love to hear from you if you have your own ideas about what makes a good Drupalcamp session. If you drop me a line or leave a comment I will take them into account while planning my own session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darren&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Surviving - and thriving - during the transition to Drupal&amp;nbsp;8</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my proposal for a session at the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupalcamp.london/&quot;&gt;Drupal Camp in London&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal is going through some big changes. And, so is the world. Now may be an unsettled period, but, times of disturbance can also be times of great opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will share my experiences with Drupal and my research into how the web and society are transforming. This will include my personal manifesto and ideas about Drupal&amp;#39;s role in the future of the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Drupal community helped me transform in many ways. I have had the opportunity to work on some of the biggest, flagship Drupal websites, and in teams of all sizes. I&amp;#39;ve grown and advanced as a developer and a human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have also been difficult times. These have included my own personal challenges, and stories I have heard from others. In my work at &lt;a href=&quot;http://ideationnetworks.com/&quot;&gt;Ideation Networks&lt;/a&gt; I sit with clients as they weigh up the pros and cons of Drupal. Many organisations feel they have been burnt by Drupal. And, for some, PHP (and by association Drupal) is just not cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, on the whole, these are exciting times for Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 is the biggest achievement of our community to date. The latest version has been completely rewritten to use modern object-oriented PHP. We refer to this process as &amp;quot;getting off the island&amp;quot;. It means dropping the &amp;quot;not invented here&amp;quot; philosophy, and embracing the wider PHP community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal as a product, a community, and a movement, is our co-creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have all played a part in Drupal&amp;#39;s success: Dries and the core development team; the wider community of contributors; the attendees of Drupal camps and conferences; people who talk about Drupal; and the developers, agencies, companies and users that drive Drupal&amp;#39;s adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session I will attempt to answer these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What have we gained, and what have we sacrificed along the way?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NGOs, charities, smaller organisations, and hobbyists made up Drupal&amp;#39;s traditional user-base. Have we shunned them as we&amp;#39;ve chased the enterprise client and big budget projects? Or, does Drupal 8 bring more of these users back into the fold?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now that we&amp;#39;ve got this amazing platform, what do we do with it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Egyptian Revolution of 2011 is just one example of the web enabling real change in the world. How does Drupal fit into the bigger picture? How can we empower more positive change in the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where do we go next? How can Drupal continue to transform and grow?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is talking about front-end frameworks, progressive decoupling, big pipe, micro-services. Innovation is more than just jumping on bandwagons. Considered from a deeper place, what do these trends tell us about the real changes that are happening? How does Drupal embrace these changes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m excited. There are some tensions to resolve, and some challenges ahead, but also big opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join me for this session. Let&amp;#39;s explore transformation of our world, the web, Drupal, and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>In Summary...</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;Things are becoming clearer.
I wrote a bit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2015/12/03/work-in-progress/&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;
about my decision to leave Facebook.
I&amp;#39;m still exploring what this means, and here&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m at now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The most important thing about technology is how it changes people.&amp;quot;
-- Jaron Lanier&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking a lot about tech in terms of it&amp;#39;s effect on people.
Jaron Lanier, in his book
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jaronlanier.com/gadgetwebresources.html&quot;&gt;You are not a Gadget&lt;/a&gt;,
talks about the idea of &amp;quot;Lock in&amp;quot; as when a technology
becomes so established (ingrained?) that it is impossible to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see we&amp;#39;re in danger of becoming &amp;quot;locked in&amp;quot; to certain ways of thinking
about how we operate online, and by leaving Facebook I&amp;#39;m forcing myself to
think about alternatives, by necessity. By &amp;quot;opting out&amp;quot; of Facebook&amp;#39;s idea
of what it means to be connected online, I&amp;#39;m motivated to think about what
I really want and build tools for myself. Hopefully what I build will
eventually be useful for others too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://indiewebcamp.com/&quot;&gt;IndieWeb&lt;/a&gt; is a growing movement to build a people-focused alternative to the corporate web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predominant business model online now is providing &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; services, locking people in, stealing their data, and selling it to advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the web can be much more than this. But it means putting people first, rather than seeing them as just &amp;quot;data&amp;quot;. Then we can unlock the power of the web as an open platform for collaboration and cocreation, and use it to inform, to connect, and to empower.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Work in Progress: The Future of (My) Web (Part 1, Leaving Facebook)</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write a post about my decision to leave Facebook (again).
It was in danger of turning into a treatise on how I see the future of the
web. So, instead, I&amp;#39;ve decided to summarise my thoughts, and post this up as a &amp;quot;Work-in-progress&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this feels a bit like déjà vu, you&amp;#39;re right. I have 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2013/12/09/create-not-consume/&quot;&gt;posted before&lt;/a&gt; about my decision to leave Facebook. 
In fact, that was almost exactly 2 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to leave. It didn&amp;#39;t work. Six months later I returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for my return was that Facebook had become
the single place where my friends organised social events.
I was locked in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB: I use the phrase &amp;quot;locked-in&amp;quot; here as a hat tip to 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jaronlanier.com/gadgetwebresources.html&quot;&gt;Jaron Lanier&lt;/a&gt;
and as a reminder to my future self to fully explain the
influence his book, You are not a Gadget, has had on my
&amp;quot;digital awakening&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I deleted my Facebook account on 10th November 2015.
This time there&amp;#39;s no going back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why will it be different this time?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the community (friendship group) that prompted my 
return to Facebook last year has since gone way past 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar&amp;#x27;s_number&quot;&gt;Dunbar&amp;#39;s number&lt;/a&gt; 
and people around me are also starting to change the way they 
use Facebook. So hopefully I wont be alone in this. 
But, I will have to make a real concerted effort to keep up with friends, 
which I hope will lead to more meaningful relationships. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I&amp;#39;m building a replacement. 
No, I&amp;#39;m not building a new Facebook. 
Let me explain...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One response I&amp;#39;ve had from people who disagree with my decision is that they could never live without Facebook. In 
particular, this tends to come from people who have family and friends scattered around the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, the truth is, Facebook doesn&amp;#39;t allow you
to do anything you couldn&amp;#39;t do before you got &amp;quot;locked in&amp;quot; to 
Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is not innovative. At least not for users. All Facebook did 
was popularise one single methodology for using the web. It created
a template into which you put yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have 1000 friends on Facebook. But, only if you 
reduce your definition of what a friend is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You define yourself using a discrete set of options, you conform to
Facebook&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;schema&amp;quot;, so you can be more easily packaged and 
sold to advertisers. I noticed Firefox put out a 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HALw5kXPeKE&quot;&gt;video on the hidden business of data&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. Kind of relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://indiewebcamp.com/monoculture&quot;&gt;monoculture&lt;/a&gt;
and that is damaging the web. 
It&amp;#39;s built by middle class white males in their 20s and 30s. 
This leads to things like 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/12/24/inadvertent-algorithmic-cruelty/&quot;&gt;Inadvertent Algorithmic Cruelty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is diverse, and the web should reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m getting distracted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was talking about building a replacement...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;IndieWeb&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I attended the Indie Web Camp in Brighton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the &#39;corporate web&#39;. 
&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;a href=&quot;http://indiewebcamp.com/&quot;&gt;IndieWeb&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I found a community of people building the web that
they want, &lt;a href=&quot;http://indiewebcamp.com/Selfdogfood&quot;&gt;Selfdogfood&lt;/a&gt; 
style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IndieWeb is about having your own website. I&amp;#39;ve pretty
much always had my own website, since I started using the 
web in the 90s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2013/12/12/how-to-be-a-cloud-survivalist-pt2/&quot;&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 about the importance of owning your own personal domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Web 1.0&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the early days of the web everyone created their own little 
space on the web.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &amp;quot;surfed&amp;quot; the web. Browsed from one site to another. 
Each site different, each site an individual expression
of creativity, each site opinionated and varied.
But now we don&amp;#39;t have variety. 
(and we&amp;#39;re in danger of not having opinion either - 
if we take all our info from Wikipedia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as the internet opens up to more of the world, 
we should be getting more diversity, not less. 
It should be getting more interesting, more opinionated,
more personal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Web 2.0&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the original dot-com bubble and collapse, 
into 2000, things look different on the web.
The &amp;quot;hype&amp;quot; of the web was over. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, Web 2.0 rose from the ashes, and offered new
opportunities, slick new designs and new business
models. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legacy of Web 2.0 is that we&amp;#39;re left with 
corporate silos and monoculture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Future web&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current accepted definition of Web 3.0 is
related to the &amp;quot;Semantic Web&amp;quot;. It brings together
ubiquitous computing, open data, and machine learning
to a point where the network becomes &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, any &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot; behaviour by the network requires 
us as humans to reduce what we think intelligence is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d rather take an optimistic view
about human potential, and then think about how the web can be used
to benefit humanity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I&#39;ve always felt that the human-centered approach to computer science leads to more interesting, more exotic, 
more wild, and more heroic adventures than the machine-supremacy approach, where information is the highest goal.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my next steps, are to continue to eat my own dog food.
That is, to keep building my own tools, that will hopefully
eventually be useful to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s move away from the &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;lock in&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; of the current dominant
corporate silos, and work to offer new ways to 
&amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;unlock&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; the benefits technology 
can offer society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means tools for communities to cocreate. 
Tools for collaboration. And tools where individual creativity
is the default option, not conforming to a standardised 
template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can no longer follow me on Facebook, but, if you&amp;#39;re still
interested in hearing about what I&amp;#39;m up to, join 
my &amp;quot;tinyletter&amp;quot; personal newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
