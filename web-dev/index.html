<p>I've been doing Drupal full time for over 6 years now. I architect complete Drupal-based solutions, troubleshoot Drupal sites, optimise Drupal setups, and develop Drupal modules.
  I love automating stuff, so DevOps has become a passion of mine.

  <p>I've worked with a wide range of clients from small indie companies through to Fortune 500 listed
    corporations. I like working on projects that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_enterprise">do good</a>. </p>
