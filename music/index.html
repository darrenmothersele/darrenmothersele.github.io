I used to work professionally as a DJ in the early 2000s. I had a few resident gigs
in Sheffield and also played occasionally in London and Germany.  Some of my
remixes and productions were heard on XFM and QTV
(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OTBfa_uMcQ">including this nonsense
that I made as a joke</a>).
Tiscali Italy commissioned me
to do a remix for them, of which I recently found an
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ1ASVu3k3k">excerpt on YouTube</a>.</p>

In 2004 I left Sheffield to move to London to run the New Media department for the record label Cooking Vinyl where I set up innovative licensing deals with early Digital Music Service providers including Napster, eMusic and iTunes. I sat on the New Media Committee at the Association for Independent Music (AIM). In 2005 I co-founded a digital musical distributor called Uploader where I designed and built bespoke systems for digital asset management and audio encoding. Uploader quickly became a leading distributor of digital music in Europe before its acquisition by IODA in 2007.

I still DJ when I get the chance. You can hear some of my DJ mixes and remixes on this page.
