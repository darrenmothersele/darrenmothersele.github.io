<div class="post-description">

 <p>
    I do DevOps (Puppet, Vagrant), web development (Ruby, Rails, PHP, Drupal), C++ (openFrameworks), hardware hacking (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc), and <a href="/music/">music</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>Cyril Live Coding</h3>
  <p>I've created my own open-source programming language for live coding of
    visuals. The source is available on GitHub and there are builds for
    OSX available on <a href="http://cyrilcode.com">the Cyril live coding
    website</a>.</p>
  <h3>Drupal</h3>
  <p>I've been doing Drupal full time for over 6 years now. I architect complete Drupal-based solutions, troubleshoot Drupal sites, optimise Drupal setups, and develop Drupal modules.
  I love automating stuff, so DevOps has become a passion of mine.
  </p>
  <p>I've worked with a wide range of clients from small indie companies through to Fortune 500 listed
    corporations. I like working on projects that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_enterprise">do good</a>. </p>
  <h3>Startups</h3>
  <p>Co-founder of <a href="http://gigaom.com/2006/09/20/ioda-uploader/">Uploader
    (digital music licensing and distribution)</a>, SaaS social business software
    provider Blueprint Connections, and <a href="http://www.apiarycloud.com">Apiary</a> Cloud DevOps.
  </p>
  <h3>Computer Science Research</h3>
  <p>
    I got a B.Sc. in Computer Science (1st class honours) from The University
    of Sheffield and was awarded the Douglas Lewin Memorial Prize for computer
    science in 2000. During my undergraduate degree I built my own object-oriented
    programming language. I went on to do four years of post-graduate research in
    computer science looking at the formal semantics of object-oriented
    languages. I did a post-graduate summer school at BRICS in Aarhus, Denmark
    in Logical Methods.
