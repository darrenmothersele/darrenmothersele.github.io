<h4>Why?</h4>

<p>I am passionate about helping others more fully experience their lives.
I am driven by finding new and creative ways to accomplish a goal.
I love to engage with people who are curious and smart.</p>

<p>I love open source and Drupal. I believe in business models based on providing value.</p>

<p>I love to provide training and help get the best out of people. I believe excellent outcomes are produced by people who have opportunities each day to do what they do well.</p>
