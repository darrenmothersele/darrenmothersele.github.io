He applies agile principles to move fast, deliver early, and iterate effectively. This is achieved with extensive automation of process, test-driven development, and continuous delivery. He believes in tech leadership through active participation in open-source communities.</p><p>Darren founded Ideation Networks in 2007 to provide software development consultancy. Initially this focused on the development of Drupal-based systems. In recent years he has specialised in building scalable front-end architectures. Darren's clients have included the BFI (British Film Institute), Moby, Paul McCartney, Viacom (MTV), Elsevier (The Lancet), Dixons, and Santander. He has worked on large content migrations, data processing pipelines, and search systems. He has built web apps, mobile apps, and smart-TV apps.</p><p>Darren has consulted on three EU-funded research programmes (P2P-Next, Saracen, and Bloomen), all about future internet technologies. This has included P2P, decentralised, and blockchain technologies.</p><p>Darren worked with CTVC through several evolutions of their TrueTube product. Initially migrating them from a proprietary system to a Drupal-powered web site, then after a few years, migrating to decoupled Drupal backend, Elasticsearch powered API, and Angular front-end. This project made headlines in 2016 for being the first ever online platform to be nominated for Channel of the Year in the BAFTA Childrens' Awards. And, in 2017 became the first ever online platform to win the award.</p><p>Prior to founding Ideation Networks, Darren co-founded a successful digital music startup. As CTO and lead developer, he designed and built large systems for mass transcoding of audio, and management of media metadata.</p><h2>Why?</h2><p>I am passionate about helping others more fully experience their lives. I am driven by finding new and creative ways to accomplish a goal. I love to engage with people who are curious and smart. I love open source. I believe in business models based on providing value. I love to provide training and help get the best out of people. I believe excellent outcomes are produced by people who have opportunities each day to do what they do well. I’m fascinated by ideas. I strongly believe we should create more than we consume. I want to live in a world where more people are creators than consumers.</p><blockquote><p>Darren is very responsive and personable; always willing to adapt to our requirements, while offering his advice and experience.
