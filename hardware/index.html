I love making things with lots of RGB LEDs, such as the Pixel Coat.

I've been playing around with various microcontroller setups and have breakout
modules that allow quick and easy prototyping of various sensor and output devices.

### Arduino

A popular microcontroller platform that is easy to understand and use. It has a
large community of users and many great resources and libraries for lots of
common tasks.

### Raspberry Pi

A full ARM system-on-a-chip that runs the Linux operating system. There are
lots of I/O ports and this is a good choice when you need more processing power
than a simple microcontroller like the Arduino gives you. The Raspberry Pi is a
great low-cost platform but it does have some drawbacks. For example, I've
struggled to drive the WS2812 LED pixel systems directly from Raspi because
the multi-tasking nature of the OS means it can't guarantee the 800khz strict
timing for the data line.

### Beagle Bone Black

A competitor to the Raspi that offers a newer ARM version and includes 2 RPUs
(real-time processing units). The Beagle Bone Black is slightly more expensive
than the Raspi and doesn't have the huge community of users and following that
the Raspi benefits from.

### Add-on modules and breakout boards

Some breakout boards and modules that I've been playing with that simplify
prototyping by providing useful functionality in an easy to use modular format:

* ENC28J60 Ethernet Module
* nRF24L01+ 2.4GHz RF Transceiver
* JY-MCU Bluetooth
* WS2812 LED Pixel
* MPU6050 3-axis Accelerometer and Gyrometer
* HMC5883L Triple Axis Magnetometer
* Ultrasonic Module HC-SR04 Distance Measuring
* DS1307 Real Time Clock I2C module
* DS1307 Real Time Clock I2C module
* Colour Recognition Sensor Detector Module TCS230 MCU Arduino
