My current work in DevOps has been spun off into a separate entity called
<a href="http://www.apiarycloud.com">Apiary</a>. The aim is to be able to
deploy websites with your eyes closed, get more development work done (or go
home early), and sleep better.

Automate infrastructure using <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a>,
and deploy to the cloud without having to worry about servers, VMs, and hosts.
If you can push to GitHub then you can deploy a website with Apiary.

Using the power of <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> you can
quickly launch a fully working local development environment that emulates
your cloud hosting setup.

Architect your site as <a href="http://12factor.net/processes">stateless processes</a>
and treat <a href="http://12factor.net/backing-services">backing services</a> as
attached resources to enable efficient scale out as demand requires.
