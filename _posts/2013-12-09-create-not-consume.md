I've toyed with deleting my Facebook account before, and today I finally did
it. I want the web to be a better place, and this is my contribution towards
that.

<!--break-->
Facebook has a well documented history of unethical behaviour, privacy
concerns and bullying, but that's not really my main concern and there's
plenty of documentation about that so I don't need repeat it all here.

It's been a year since Anil Dash published
<a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html">The Web we Lost</a>,
and the situation hasn't really improved. In that article Anil laments the loss
of the free open web we used to know, as we move towards the monolithic walled
garden of the billion dollar social networks.

When I started using the internet in the mid 90s it was a wide open space of
free information, and anyone could join, create, and post. Yeah, this may still
be the case... but importantly the <em>default option</em> was that you owned and
controled everything you posted online. When I got my first
computer as a kid (Commodore 16 for anyone who's interested), it booted
straight to a BASIC interpreter when you turned it on. The <em>default
option</em> was to start creating things.

This is not the case today. We've traded control for simplicity, and the balance
has shifted in favour of consuming, rather than creating.

The often touted 'big-win' is that the usability, the mobile apps, and the
simplicity of these networks like Facebook have widened the net and bought
social web technology into the lives of everyone. Everyone can have a 'digital
life'... create posts, upload photos and share them with friends. But, what they
don't have is control over that 'digital life'.

I don't own a TV, but I do know people who spend all their free time glued to
the TV watching mind-numbing rubbish. Likewise, I know people who's instinctive action
whenever they have a spare minute is to reach for their phone and check
Facebook. I want to help people address the balance between creating and consuming.
I want a better web, and I want to live in a world where more people are
creators than consumers. I think projects like
<a href="https://webmaker.org/en-GB/">Mozilla's webmaker</a> can help
with this. But, the first step is to regain control...
