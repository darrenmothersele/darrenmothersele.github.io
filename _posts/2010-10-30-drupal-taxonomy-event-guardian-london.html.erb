<p>Hello, just a quick note to say I will be presenting at the next Drupal Drop-in event at the Guardian's offices in London. I will be talking about taxonomy - in particular Active Tags and using Views with Taxonomies. The event details are yet to be posted, but look out on the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/org/61878136" rel="nofollow">Eventbrite</a> page for more details. The event will be on the 9th Nov.</p>
