<p>I will be presenting at the forthcoming <a href="http://drupal.org.uk/">Drupal for Enterprise</a> event being organised by Drupal UK.  The event is on <strong>13th Aug</strong> and is being held at Sun Microsystems. You can register for this event <a href="http://drupalforenterprise.eventbrite.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Details are still being confirmed but I will be presenting something on integration of Drupal with other systems. This could include external user authentication, and the work I have done in the past integrating Drupal with accounting systems, and webbots to process sales information feeds.</p>
